We
were
then
charged
for
their
most
expensive
sake
(
$
20
+
per
serving
)
when
we
in
fact
drank
a
sake
of
less
than
half
that
price
.

Amma
is
nothing
special
.

Great
atmoshere
and
worth
every
bit
.

delicious
bagels
,
especially
when
right
out
of
the
oven
.

Go
here
.

Highly
recommended
!

But
who
says
Murray's
is
anything
about
service
.

The
atmosphere
was
mostly
of
an
older
crowd
,
but
there
were
a
few
groups
of
mid
20
'
s
/
30
year
olds
also
.

Just
straight
up
cheap
,
good
food
.

The
service
was
terrible
,
we
had
to
wait
for
everything
and
ask
several
of
different
people
for
the
same
thing
before
we
were
allowed
to
be
served
.

This
is
a
great
place
to
get
a
delicious
meal
.

Um
so
now
what
are
appetizers
for
?
?
?

I
agree
that
dining
at
Casa
La
Femme
is
like
no
other
dining
experience
!

It
wasn't
the
freshest
seafood
ever
,
but
the
taste
and
presentation
was
OK
.

They
have
authentic
Indian
at
amazin
prices
.

The
food
was
delicious
(
I
had
a
halibut
special
,
my
husband
had
steak
)
,
and
the
service
was
top-notch
.

the
food
is
decent
.

i
am
never
disappointed
with
there
food
.

everyone
was
cheerfully
cooperative
and
helpful
.

the
bus
boy
even
spotted
that
my
table
was
shaking
a
stabilized
it
for
me
.

–
This
place
is
famous
for
their
breakfast
.

When
I
got
there
I
sat
up
stairs
where
the
atmosphere
was
cozy
&
the
service
was
horrible
!

It
is
set
far
from
the
small
street
it's
on
,
and
there
is
no
traffic
noise
.

–
Save
yourself
the
waste
of
time
&
DO
NOT
visit
.

Recommendations
,
of
course
,
are
required
!

Also
they
were
$
15
each
!

Two
thumbs
up
!

This
guy
refused
to
seat
her
and
she
left
,
followed
shortly
by
the
four
of
us
,
but
not
before
I
told
him
that
in
my
40
years
of
world
travel
,
including
Paris
,
that
I
had
never
seen
such
a
display
of
bad
behavior
by
a
frontman
in
a
restaurant
.

I
really
liked
this
place
.

The
filet
mignon
dish
was
superb
!

Lucky
Strike
is
a
great
casual
place
to
just
grab
a
bite
to
eat
.

I
have
never
been
so
disgusted
by
both
food
an
service
.

So
,
if
you're
walking
by
and
thinking
about
dining
,
you
might
want
to
see
who's
going
to
be
seating
you
first
...

Good
for
late
night
dining
(
last
minute
planning
)
without
reservations
.

Expensive

The
pizza
is
delicious
-
they
use
fresh
mozzarella
instead
of
the
cheap
,
frozen
,
shredded
cheese
common
to
most
pizzaria's
.

service
is
friendly
,
and
never
had
a
problem
walking
in
and
getting
a
table
.

I
can't
remember
the
last
time
I
had
such
gross
food
in
New
York
.

The
only
beverage
we
did
receive
was
water
in
dirty
glasses
!

Can't
wait
to
go
back
.

Guacamole
+
shrimp
appetizer
was
really
great
,
we
both
had
the
filet
,
very
good
,
didn't
much
like
the
frites
that
came
with
,
but
the
filet
was
so
good
,
neither
of
us
cared
.

The
wine
list
is
excellent
.

I
had
Lobster
Bisque
it
has
2
oz
.
of
Maine
Lobster
in
it
.

The
hostess
was
very
pleasant
.

The
best
thing
is
,
the
prices
are
also
quite
reasonable
.

I
won't
go
back
unless
someone
else
is
footing
the
bill
.

The
main
entree
was
also
very
good
.

Great
place
,
great
value
.

The
food
is
fantastic
,
and
the
waiting
staff
has
been
perfect
every
single
time
we've
been
there
.

Both
times
I
was
extremely
dissappointed
by
the
service
,
which
was
boarderline
rude
.

Just
went
here
for
my
girlfriends
23rd
bday
.

I
am
going
to
the
mid
town
location
next
.

delicious
simple
food
in
nice
outdoor
atmosphere
.

Less
than
three
minutes
passed
before
I
found
myself
doubled
over
the
toilet
.

The
omlette
for
brunch
is
great
...

The
level
of
rudeness
was
preposterous
.

I'm
still
mad
that
i
had
to
pay
for
lousy
food
.

Love
the
scene
first
off
-
the
place
has
a
character
and
nice
light
to
it
..
very
fortunate
,
location
wise
.

The
atmosphere
was
pretty
nice
but
had
a
bit
lacking
,
which
it
tries
to
make
up
for
with
a
crazy
scheme
of
mirrors
.

The
in-house
lady
DJ
on
Saturday
nights
has
outrageously
good
taste
in
music
,
and
moreover
,
takes
requests
.

A
pleasant
surprise
.

The
food
arrived
in
about
15
minutes
.

Their
sake
list
was
extensive
,
but
we
were
looking
for
Purple
Haze
,
which
wasn't
listed
but
made
for
us
upon
request
!

i
don't
usually
order
wine
with
indian
so
i
can't
comment
on
their
wine
list
or
their
wines
.

Authentic
Pakistani
food
.

All
in
all
,
this
midtown
gem
instantly
became
one
of
my
favorite
sushi
restaurants
in
the
city
.

Not
the
typical
NYC
gimmick
theme
restaurant
.

I
complete
the
total
bagel
experience
by
having
it
lightly
toasted
.

We
had
a
very
nice
time
.

My
family
ate
here
last
weekend
.

We
live
nearby
BFC
.

While
it's
not
Nobu
,
it
sure
is
a
great
deal
and
you
definitely
will
leave
feeling
satisfied
and
full
.

So
for
the
'
after
beach
excursion
'
,
we
thought
we
would
end
the
day
on
a
high
note
and
make
the
trip
across
the
street
from
the
beach
to
Park
Chalet
.

The
one
on
the
east
side
is
much
better
than
the
one
on
the
west
side
.

Nice
Family
owned
traditional
restaurant
.

I
lived
on
50th
st
,
and
wanted
Indian
one
day
so
decided
to
check
this
place
out
.

Our
experience
did
not
ever
get
any
better
.

I
don
’
t
usually
visit
the
same
establishment
more
than
once
,
what
more
twice
,
but
I
’
ll
come
to
Zenkichi
anytime
for
a
quiet
,
unhurried
and
memorable
dinner
.

and
yes
Dal
Bukhara
is
so
dam
good
and
so
are
all
the
kababs
.

The
pizza
’
s
are
not
huge
and
the
crust
is
thin
…
keep
that
in
mind
when
you
’
re
ordering
.

Ciao
Bella

Food
was
good
not
great
not
worth
the
wait
or
another
visit

Even
my
Indian
friend
couldn't
believe
how
good
and
tasty
everything
was
.

My
friend
devoured
her
chicken
and
mashed
potatos
.

The
pizza
itself
is
not
exactly
the
best
I've
had
EVER
,
but
still
pretty
good
.

Terrible
,
terrible
management
-
deserves
to
be
shut-down
.

It's
a
small
cute
restaurant
.

I
felt
as
though
I
were
eating
in
Paris
.

the
salads
are
delicious
,
both
refreshing
and
very
spicy
.

Worth
visiting
the
1st
Ave
spot
because
it
is
the
original
store
.

This
is
one
of
my
favorite
restaurants
and
it
is
not
to
be
missed
.

The
entertainment
was
great
they
have
shows
that
go
on
through
out
the
dinner
.

–
The
food
was
not
great
&
the
waiters
were
rude
.

Whether
it's
the
parmesean
porcini
souffle
or
the
lamb
glazed
with
balsamic
vinegar
,
you
will
surely
be
transported
to
Northern
Italy
with
one
bite
.

The
food
options
rule
.

Mussles
and
calamari
were
superb
Saturday
evening
.

AMAZING
.

I
went
there
after
hearing
how
great
it
was
.

The
floor
was
wet
,
the
trash
can
filled
with
hand
towels
n
all
over
the
floor
,
no
soap
,
and
no
hand
towels
left
.

I
was
in
love
with
Pongsri
on
48th
,
but
compared
to
Suan
it
is
slow
in
service
and
overpriced
.

The
waitress
was
very
patient
with
us
and
the
food
is
phenomenal
!

The
food
'
s
as
good
as
ever
.

Go
here
for
a
romantic
dinner
but
not
for
an
all
out
wow
dining
experience
.

With
the
theater
2
blocks
away
we
had
a
delicious
meal
in
a
beautiful
room
.

Very
immature
bartender
,
didnt
know
how
to
make
specific
drinks
,
service
was
so
slowwwww
,
the
food
was
not
fresh
or
warm
,
waitresses
were
busy
flirting
with
men
at
the
bar
and
werent
very
attentive
to
all
the
customers
.

The
food
is
excellent
!

My
wife
had
barely
touched
that
mess
of
a
dish
.

Ambience
is
delightful
,
service
impeccable
.

The
place
is
a
BISTRO
which
means
:
simple
dishes
and
wine
served
efficiently
in
a
bustling
atmosphere
.

Great
neighborhood
joint
.

What
you
are
paying
for
is
the
environment
and
the
name
.

The
dishes
offered
were
unique
,
very
tasty
and
fresh
from
the
lamb
sausages
,
sardines
with
biscuits
,
large
whole
shrimp
to
the
amazing
pistachio
ice
cream
(
the
best
and
freshest
I've
ever
had
)
.

Don't
leave
the
restaurant
without
it
.

Quite
simply
it's
like
stepping
out
of
Manhattan
and
into
a
haven
of
tranquility
.

I
was
literally
going
to
explode
,
but
instead
,
my
boyfriend
took
the
bill
and
went
to
find
the
manager
.

This
is
the
BEST
Shabu-Shabu
Restaurant
in
the
Try-State
Area
.

Try
the
crunchy
tuna
,
it
is
to
die
for
.

–
I
can't
believe
Murphy's
has
been
around
for
over
25
years
,
amazing
.

The
food
is
good
,
I
can't
lie
.

Me
and
my
girls
will
definitely
go
back
.

Delectable

Raga's
is
a
romantic
,
cozy
restaurant
.

Great
place
to
relax
and
enjoy
your
dinner

So
here
we
are
,
my
wife
,
3
year
old
daughter
and
I
trying
to
pass
the
time
by
hanging
out
in
the
front
of
the
building
(
where
the
murals
and
artifacts
are
)
.

Excellent
food
for
great
prices

Once
we
finally
got
a
table
,
despite
indicating
we
wanted
an
alla
carte
menu
we
were
pushed
into
a
table
that
was
only
price
fixed
!

I
have
to
say
I
have
never
had
a
disapointing
meal
here
.

i
would
just
ask
for
no
oil
next
time
.

Slightly
above
average
wines
start
at
$
70
+
with
only
one
selection
listed
at
$
30
+
.

At
first
glance
this
place
seems
a
bit
pricey
for
a
hot
dog
joint
,
but
at
Bark
you
don't
just
get
your
average
hot
dog
.

Admittedly
some
nights
inside
the
restaurant
were
rather
warm
,
but
the
open
kitchen
is
part
of
the
charm
.

We
had
a
great
time
at
the
Jekyll
and
hyde
Pub
last
night
.

An
awesome
organic
dog
,
and
a
conscious
eco
friendly
establishment
.

You
can
get
a
completely
delish
martini
in
a
glass
(
that's
about
2
1/2
drinks
)
for
$
8.50
(
I
recommend
the
Vanilla
Shanty
,
mmmm
!
)
in
a
great
homey
setting
with
great
music
.

But
the
space
is
small
and
lovely
,
and
the
service
is
helpful
.

Poor
service
and
management

$
500
included
:

The
veal
was
incredible
last
night
.

Great
service
,
great
food
.

I've
been
to
at
Cafe
Spice
probably
5-8
times
,
it
is
probably
still
the
best
Indian
restaurant
around
Union
Square
.

The
service
was
attentive
.

Tiny
dessert
was
$
8.00
...
just
plain
overpriced
for
what
it
is
.

Our
family
never
expected
such
incredible
entertainment
in
a
restaurant
.

Delicious
,
creative
and
fun
.

WOW
!
!
!

Very
good
wine
choices
.

I've
eaten
at
many
different
Indian
restaurants
.

Interesting
selection
,
good
wines
,
service
fine
,
fun
decor
.

The
food
was
delicious
but
do
not
come
here
on
a
empty
stomach
.

The
crust
is
thin
,
the
ingredients
are
fresh
and
the
staff
is
friendly
.

–
This
is
my
"
must
bring
out
of
town
guests
to
"
restaurant
and
they
always
enjoy
and
rave
about
it
.

I
didn't
complain
,
I
liked
the
atmosphere
so
much
.

There
is
a
downside
if
you're
ordering
in
-
-
the
delivery
guys
have
MAJOR
attitude
.

You
cannot
go
wrong
with
this
place
.

The
food
is
delicious
-
from
the
specials
to
the
regular
menu-fare
,
the
dishes
are
never
a
disappointment
.

However
,
if
you
want
great
food
at
a
great
price
and
don't
mind
the
decor
,
you
can't
beat
this
place
.

Being
serious
sushi
lovers
,
we
sat
at
the
sushi
bar
to
be
closer
to
the
action
.

Add
to
that
great
service
and
great
food
at
a
reasonable
price
and
you
have
yourself
the
beginning
of
a
great
evening
.

I
would
go
back
.

Hats
off
to
the
chef
.

My
main
concern
was
the
sanity
of
the
food
that
was
being
sent
out
to
myself
and
others
,
but
I
would
be
lying
is
I
said
that
as
someone
who
has
worked
in
restaurants
since
the
age
of
fifteen
I
was
expecting
at
least
a
minimal
effort
on
the
part
of
the
restaurant
to
amend
the
situation
.

Server
made
several
sake
suggestions
which
were
very
good
.

It's
great
to
go
for
a
quick
lunch
either
alone
or
with
a
friend
.

Great
food
,
better
Margaritas
!

Every
time
"
0
-
sixtynine
"
is
called
the
bartender
buys
everyone
drinks
!

How
do
you
rate
home
?

The
wine
list
is
extensive
and
impressive
.

Pizza
is
terrific
,
as
is
homemade
pasta
.

Cry
me
a
river
,
stop
complaining
you
obviously
you
have
no
taste
in
food
.

We
stood
there
for
10
minutes
while
employees
walked
back
and
forth
ignoring
us
.

For
a
restaurant
with
such
a
good
reputation
and
that
is
usually
so
packed
,
there
was
no
reason
for
such
a
lack
of
intelligent
customer
service
.

we
were
tired
and
cold
when
we
got
to
the
restaurant
,
then
we
sat
down
to
begin
ordering
appetizers
.

Judging
from
previous
posts
this
used
to
be
a
good
place
,
but
not
any
longer
.

All
the
staff
is
absolutely
professional
!
!

Our
teenage
kids
love
it
,
too
.

What
a
tastly
,
flaky
treat
!

Worst
Service
I
Ever
Had

The
pizza
is
delicious
and
the
proprietor
is
one
of
the
nicest
in
NYC
.

Yes
,
the
place
is
classy
and
beautiful
,
but
they
most
certainly
target
the
uber
whealthy
Not
the
common
joe
that
wants
to
go
all
out
every
once
in
a
while
.

Despite
a
slightly
limited
menu
,
everything
prepared
is
done
to
perfection
,
ultra
fresh
and
a
work
of
food
art
.

Service
is
not
exactly
five
star
,
but
thats
not
really
a
big
deal
.

The
freshest
,
best
variety
,
and
the
fastest
delivery
.

It
is
quite
a
spectacular
scene
i'll
give
them
that
.

Avoid
this
place
!

By
far
,
the
best
pizza
in
Manhattan
.

Best
of
all
is
the
warm
vibe
,
the
owner
is
super
friendly
and
service
is
fast
.

The
staff
are
friendly
and
the
decor
was
ethic
and
colorful
.

Probably
would
not
go
again
...

Arigato
Gozimas
Yuka
!

The
music
is
great
,
no
night
better
or
worse
,
the
bar
tenders
are
generous
with
the
pouring
,
and
the
lighthearted
atmosphere
will
lifts
you
spirits
.

What's
the
difference
between
the
two
?

–
I
decided
to
eat
at
Stack
because
of
their
price
fixed
pre-show
dinner
.

It's
all
about
the
food
!
!

this
is

–
first
of
all
henrymillionare
you
dont
know
a
thing
about
middle
eastern
food
so
dont
talk
.

The
place
is
small
and
intimate
and
you
may
feel
a
little
crowded
,
but
the
service
is
excellent
and
it's
great
for
friends
out
,
a
romantic
date
,
or
a
special
occassion
.

The
place
is
beautiful
!

Only
complaint
is
the
pricing--I
believe
it
would
be
more
reasonable
to
pay
a
dollar
less
on
each
item
listed
on
the
menu
.

One
of
the
BEST

We
were
very
pleasantly
surprised
.

Love
YUKA
.

Thanks
Bloom's
for
a
lovely
trip
.

Don't
miss
Bloom's
on
your
next
trip
to
Manhatten
.

the
ambiance
of
the
restaurant
was
nice
and
good
for
fine
dinning
.

Luckily
we
saved
room
for
the
BBQ
Salmon
,
Sea
Bass
and
Crispy
Duck
.

The
martinis
are
amazing
and
very
fairly
priced
.

I
just
found
out
that
you
can
have
the
place
to
yourself
on
nights
and
weekends
for
a
private
party
-
can't
wait
to
celebrate
my
next
birthday
there
.

They
have
great
rolls
,
the
triple
color
and
norwegetan
rolls
,
are
awesome
and
filling
.

Wait
staff
is
blantently
unappreciative
of
your
business
but
its
the
best
pie
on
the
UWS
!

The
lava
cake
dessert
was
incredible
and
I
recommend
it
.

That
place
was
awesome
,
,
,
sally
!

In
the
past
sake
usuallly
just
tasted
kind
of
like
salty
water
to
me
.

and
the
waiter
suggested
a
perfect
sake
!
!

We
visited
Orsay
during
NY
Restaurant
Week
and
tried
their
$
35
menu
.

On
a
recent
trip
,
our
waiter
was
extremely
dismissive
,
while
no
less
than
three
staff
members
waited
hand-and-foot
on
a
pair
of
Japanese
girls
seated
nearby
.

Every
time
in
New
York
I
make
it
a
point
to
visit
Restaurant
Saul
on
Smith
Street
.

I
never
used
to
be
a
fan
of
sakes
but
am
lately
experimenting
with
it
a
lot
more
and
am
acquiring
a
better
taste
of
it
.

Highly
impressed
from
the
decor
to
the
food
to
the
hospitality
to
the
great
night
I
had
!

I
have
been
here
,
spent
tons
of
money
on
a
chef
special
dinner
and
it
was
a
major
dissappointment
.

The
service
is
excellent
,
the
decor
is
great
,
and
the
food
is
delicious
and
comes
in
large
portions
.

I
asked
for
an
open
faced
cheese
sandwich
and
the
manager
basically
told
me
to
take
my
business
elsewhere
!

But
if
you're
prepared
to
spend
some
$
and
remember
to
ask
if
something
they
offer
is
complimentary
,
then
this
is
the
place
to
go
for
Indian
food

With
the
great
variety
on
the
menu
,
I
eat
here
often
and
never
get
bored
.

Great
seasonal
fish
and
seafood
,
with
a
classy
waterfront
setting
.

Great
find
in
the
West
Village
!

I've
been
wanting
to
go
to
this
place
forever
and
finally
got
a
table
.

We
were
offered
water
for
the
table
but
were
not
told
the
Voss
bottles
of
water
were
$
8
a
piece
.

The
potato
balls
were
not
dry
at
all
...
in
fact
it
was
buttery
.

–
After
12
years
in
Seattle
Ray's
rates
as
the
place
we
always
go
back
to
.

I
did
not
try
the
caviar
but
I
tried
their
salmon
and
crab
salad
(
they
are
all
good
)

As
many
other
reviewers
noticed
,
your
order
is
often
slow
to
arrive
-
this
is
particularly
true
in
the
evening
but
is
not
a
problem
during
lunch
time
.

A
brief
conversation
with
the
manager
at
the
end
of
the
meal
was
the
greatest
disappointment--to
say
we
had
been
"
blown
off
"
would
be
an
understatement
.

Sushi
experience
was
unbelievable
with
my
fiance
.

The
dessert
(
we
had
a
pear
torte
)
was
good
-
but
,
once
again
,
the
staff
was
unable
to
provide
appropriate
drink
suggestions
.

It
was
served
with
skin
,
over
a
bed
of
extremely
undercooked
spinach
and
mashed
potatoes
.

Always
a
winner
.

Suan
is
a
great
place
that
I
often
take
my
friends
(
classmates
)
too
.

Compared
to
other
shabu
restaurants
around
town
,
this
places
wins
hands-down
.

Although
the
service
could
be
improved
considering
the
money
you
put
in
.

Service
was
just
ok
,
it
is
not
what
you'd
expect
for
$
500
.

They
refuse
to
seat
parties
of
3
or
more
on
weekends
.

for
desert
we
had
the
mango
ginger
creme
brulee
...
oh
la
la
yummy
!
!
!

This
place
has
totally
weird
decor
,
stairs
going
up
with
mirrored
walls
-
I
am
surprised
how
no
one
yet
broke
their
head
or
fall
off
the
stairs
-
mirrored
walls
make
you
dizzy
and
delusional
...

I
recently
went
to
this
restaurant
with
some
co-workers
for
lunch
and
had
an
amazing
time
.

Regardless
,
we'll
be
back
and
can't
wait
to
visit
in
the
summer
to
take
advantage
of
the
patio
.

Service
was
slow
,
but
the
people
were
friendly
.

The
prices
are
outrageous
,
especially
since
the
food
was
actually
less
satisfying
than
most
neighborhood
Chinese
establishments
.

My
friends
and
I
were
on
vacation
in
NY
and
was
referred
to
Chance
by
a
friend
.

At
best
,
the
food
was
good
and
definately
overpriced
.

Not
what
I
would
expect
for
the
price
and
prestige
of
this
location
.

But
the
service
is
HORRID
!

However
,
the
value
and
service
are
both
severely
lacking
.

The
tables
are
crammed
way
too
close
,
the
menu
is
typical
of
any
Italian
restaurant
,
and
the
wine
list
is
simply
overpriced
.

i
love
this
place
!

The
appetizers
we
ordered
were
served
quickly
-
an
order
of
fried
oysters
and
clams
were
delicious
but
a
tiny
portion
(
maybe
3
of
each
)
.

Price
and
quality
of
fish
alone
will
keep
us
from
making
a
return
visit
.

I
can't
wait
for
summer
,
when
they
serve
outside
on
their
gigantic
patio
.

You
can
do
it
here
.

My
boyfriend
and
I
went
there
to
celebrate
my
birthday
the
other
night
and
all
I
can
say
is
that
it
was
magnificent
.

It
wasn't
as
if
this
restaurant
had
any
major
bragging
points
before
hand
,
but
now
it's
simply
repulsive
.

Too
bad
the
food
wasn't
of
the
same
heritage
.

And
it
all
comes
at
a
very
reasonable
price
(
congee
,
noodles
,
and
rice
dishes
are
no
more
than
$
3-6
each
)
.

Addicting
!

would
NOT
go
back
.

supercilious
scorn
is
in
.

I've
been
here
twice
now
.

Small
servings
for
main
entree
,
i
had
salmon
(
wasnt
impressed
)
girlfriend
had
chicken
,
it
was
good
.

Just
ignore
the
trendy
wannabes
.

great
service

So
rushing
us
out
was
absolutely
unnecessary
!

With
so
many
good
restaurants
on
the
UWS
,
I
don't
need
overpriced
food
,
absurdly
arrogant
wait-staff
who
don't
recognize
they
work
at
a
glorified
diner
,
clumsy
service
,
and
management
that
doesn't
care
.

One
of
the
best
Sushi
place
in
town
.

The
9
oz
steak
came
next
and
it
tasted
great
,
at
least
initially
.

The
owners
are
great
fun
and
the
beer
selection
is
worth
staying
for
.

What
?

–
I
highly
recommend
Mioposto
.

I
highly
recommend
Caviar
Russe
to
anyone
who
wants
delicious
top
grade
caviar
and
fantastic
service
.

Ingredients
are
organic
which
is
a
real
plus
for
me
.

Went
there
for
an
office
lunch
.

Have
been
dozens
of
times
and
never
failed
to
enjoy
the
experience
.

This
is
a
nice
pizza
place
with
good
selection
of
thin
crust
pizza
including
the
Basil
slice
.

He
offers
subpar
service
and
has
no
personality
.

Food
-
awesome
.

The
wine
list
is
incredible
and
extensive
and
diverse
,
the
food
is
all
incredible
and
the
staff
was
all
very
nice
,
good
at
their
jobs
and
cultured
.

I
have
eaten
here
three
times
and
have
found
the
quality
and
variety
of
the
fish
to
be
excellent
.

We
did
have
the
same
waiter
the
second
time
,
so
maybe
the
service
is
spotty
and
our
luck
is
good
.

And
the
upstairs
is
a
great
place
to
hang
out
.

Over
the
years
the
host
,
Vittorio
,
and
his
crew
,
have
always
treated
me
as
family--although
with
all
the
business
this
not-so-little
gem
does
,
it
amazing
he's
even
able
to
remember
a
consistent
but
not-so-frequent
visitor
.

Mizu
is
home
to
creative
and
unique
rolls
not
to
found
anywhere
else
.

I
love
Ess-a-bagel
,
but
I
live
on
the
west
side
,
so
I
often
go
to
Murray's
for
convenience
.

Cut
to
the
chase
-
this
is
amazing
!

Oh
yeah
...
the
view
was
good
,
too
.

It
was
wonderful
.

The
baked
clams
octopus
we
shared
as
appetizers
were
the
best
we've
ever
had
!
!

I
pray
it
stays
open
forever
.

The
portion
sizes
here
are
huge
,
and
the
sushi
is
good
.

Good
spreads
,
great
beverage
selections
and
bagels
really
tasty
.

A
Thai
restaurant
out
of
rice
during
dinner
?

Melt
in
your
mouth
nigiri
and
sashmi
,
and
very
tasty
rolls
too
.

i
would
recommend
reservations
on
weekends
though
.

Worth
the
trip
from
Manhattan
.

So
eat
fast
and
order
a
lot
.

Sauce
was
watery
and
the
food
didn't
have
much
flavor
.

More
Williamsburg
Garbage

I
am
so
happy
to
have
a
wonderful
Italian
restaurant
in
my
neighborhood
.

This
place
would
be
so
much
better
served
by
being
run
by
a
group
that
actually
understands
customer
service
.

I
thought
going
to
Jimmys
would
give
me
a
real
Domincan
exprience
.

The
food
is
all
shared
so
we
get
to
order
together
and
eat
together
.

I've
also
been
amazed
at
all
the
new
additions
in
the
past
few
years
:
A
new
Jazz
Bar
,
the
most
fantastic
Dining
Garden
,
the
Best
Thin
Crust
Pizzas
,
and
now
a
Lasagna
Menu
which
is
to
die
for
(
these
are
not
your
average
lasagnas
)
!

–
This
past
weekend
had
great
weather
for
San
Francisco
standards
.

We
went
around
9:30
on
a
Friday
and
it
had
died
down
a
bit
by
then
so
the
service
was
great
!

Cool
atmosphere
,
the
fire
place
in
the
back
really
ads
to
it
but
needs
a
bit
more
heat
throughout
on
a
cold
night
.

The
food
was
very
good
,
a
great
deal
,
and
the
place
its
self
was
great
.

those
rolls
were
big
,
but
not
good
and
sashimi
wasn't
fresh
.

Love
it
.

We
were
ushered
to
the
bar
to
wait
momentarily
and
upon
arrival
were
so
excited
.

The
best
Chuwam
Mushi
I
have
ever
had
.

Much
more
than
just
a
great
view
!

We
had
a
very
hard
time
getting
the
waitress
'
attention
and
finally
had
to
get
up
and
go
inside
to
speak
to
a
manager
.

I
was
pleasantly
suprised
.

Inexpensive
,
unassuming
,
great
time
!

highly
recommended
.

The
restaurant
is
a
bit
noisy
but
that
is
something
that
can
be
overlooked
once
you
sit
down
and
enjoy
a
great
meal

Holy
Hummus
!

The
first
time
I
went
,
and
was
completely
taken
by
the
live
jazz
band
and
atmosphere
,
I
ordered
the
Lobster
Cobb
Salad
.

The
view
is
spectacular
,
and
the
food
is
great
.

I
had
the
beef
kabobs
with
a
side
of
cucumber
yogurt
.

I
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
this
gem
in
Hoboken
.

I
had
never
had
Edamame
pureed
before
but
I
thought
it
was
innovative
and
tasty
(
could've
used
a
bit
more
salt
)
.

The
lobster
sandwich
is
$
24
and
although
it
was
good
it
was
not
nearly
enough
to
warrant
that
price
.

Check
out
the
secret
back
room
.

The
waiter
was
attentive
.

I
choose
to
go
with
one
of
the
special
,
the
braised
lamb
shank
in
red
wine
,
which
was
excellent
.

The
staff
is
no
nonsense
.

Bukhara
is
on
my
top
5
Indian
places
in
NYC

Surprised
that
a
place
of
this
caliber
would
advertise
it
as
Kobe
.

The
pizza
’
s
are
thin
crust
and
the
menu
offers
very
creative
combinations
and
toppings
.

The
only
problem
would
be
the
wait
,
but
we
usually
just
have
a
drink
in
the
front
while
waiting
.

I'm
not
picky
-
but
it
was
actually
gross
.

This
place
is
always
packed
.

We
ordered
dosut
bibimbap
and
nakgi-bokum
.

I
am
not
the
most
experienced
person
when
it
comes
to
Thai
food
,
but
my
friend
who
took
me
there
is
.

I've
had
better
chicken
at
BBQs
!
!
!

and
you
can't
beat
the
prices
.

The
food
was
well
prepared
and
the
service
impecable
.

The
service
was
exceptional
-
sometime
there
was
a
feeling
that
we
were
served
by
the
army
of
friendly
waiters
.

Yamato
is
an
excellent
place
to
go
if
youre
not
into
sashimi
,
or
if
you
have
friends
who
doesnt
like
sushi
much
.

I
take
all
my
NYC
guests
to
VT's
.

The
place
is
the
next
best
thing
to
my
Moms
cooking
.

(
i
hang
out
,
and
live
,
in
the
neighborhood
..
)

Try

Reliable
,
Fresh
Sushi

i
love
margherita
pizza
–
i
looove
east
village
pizza

Over
all
the
looks
of
the
place
exceeds
the
actual
meals
.

Mistakes
happen
,
but
they
are
usually
accompanied
by
an
apology
,
perhaps
even
a
glass
of
wine
...
but
not
the
grunt
that
we
received
from
the
Al
Di
La
staff
.

The
chicken
pot
pie
is
excpetiona
,
the
cheeseburger
huge
and
delictable
,
and
the
service
professional
wan
warm
.

This
is
the
best
sushi
in
new
york
city
-
hands
down
.

Brunch
at

I
love
this
restaurant

We
went
here
for
lunch
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
on
a
Saturday
,
and
I
was
thoroughly
impressed
with
the
food
.

I
went
here
with
my
boyfriend
for
our
anniversary
.

But
the
servers
were
extremely
attentive
and
very
friendly
.

Most
of
the
servers
are
very
attentive
,
friendly
and
quite
attractive
.

Creative
,
consistent
,
fresh
.

The
food
was
lousy
-
too
sweet
or
too
salty
and
the
portions
tiny
.

The
waitress
came
to
check
in
on
us
every
few
minutes
,
and
began
to
clear
the
plates
while
half
of
us
were
still
eating
(
a
big
pet
peeve
of
mine
that
happens
almost
everywhere
,
so
I
try
to
ignore
it
)
.

Service
was
devine
,
oysters
where
a
sensual
as
they
come
,
and
the
price
can't
be
beat
!
!
!

No
,
really
.

The
meat
is
fresh
,
the
sauces
are
great
,
you
get
kimchi
and
a
salad
free
with
your
meal
and
service
is
good
too
.

Super
YUMMY
Pizza
!

Great
,
original
taste
.

We
were
10
people
celebrtating
a
birthday
,
we
sat
in
the
tent
.

I
will
have
to
do
more
research
before
checking
out
new
places
based
on
Diners
,
drive-ins
and
dives
reviews
.

You
can't
go
wrong
here
.

I've
always
found
the
wait
staff
and
,
if
you
sit
at
the
bar
,
the
cooks
very
friendly
.

Never
too
crowded
and
always
great
service
.

It
is
definitely
a
good
spot
for
snacks
and
chat
.

After
passing
by
this
restaurant
for
sometime
I
finally
decided
to
go
in
and
have
dinner
.

–
I
took
my
parents
here
for
their
anniversary-very
very
disappointed
!
!
!

Their
apps
are
all
delicious
.

Not
alot
of
smoking
places
left
in
New
York
,
but
I
have
found
my
favorite
smoking
balconey
in
the
city
.

it
was
really
good
pizza
.

The
fish
was
not
fresh
and
the
rice
tasted
old
and
stale
.

Food
was
just
average
...
if
they
lowered
the
prices
just
a
bit
,
it
would
be
a
bigger
draw
.

First
of
all
Dal
Bukhara
Rocks
.

–
i
have
been
eating
at
this
place
for
over
8
years
now
and
i
have
never
had
one
bad
meal
.

Great
wine
selection
,
Gigondas
is
worth
the
price
,
and
the
house
champagne
is
a
great
value
.

Insultingly
Overpriced

For
the
price
,
you
cannot
eat
this
well
in
Manhattan
.

Salads
were
fantastic
.

The
wait
staff
is
very
courteous
and
accomodating
.

–
We
dined
at
the
Colorado
location
today
.

–
I've
been
to
Open
Sesame
only
once
,
but
I'm
still
reeling
from
the
experience
!
!

The
food
here
is
rather
good
,
but
only
if
you
like
to
wait
for
it
.

Why
?

I'd
highly
recommend
it
for
a
special
occasion
-
-
it
provides
and
intimate
setting
and
nice
service
.

Warm
and
friendly
in
the
winter
and
terrific
outdoor
seating
in
the
warmer
months
.

Good
Sushi
,
High
Price

We
love
the
food
,
drinks
,
and
atmosphere
!

The
crust
has
a
great
bite
and
a
good
chew
,
the
sauce
is
light
with
a
nice
acidity
to
it
,
the
salt
from
the
cheese
is
great
,
really
heightens
the
flavor
of
all
the
other
components
.

Went
here
on
sat
1/26
and
was
disappointed
.

As
part
of
a
small
party
of
four
,
our
food
was
dropped
off
without
comment
;

The
food
can
get
pricey
but
the
prixe
fixe
tasting
menu
is
the
greatest
food
for
a
good
price
and
they
cater
the
food
to
any
food
allergies
or
food
you
don't
like
.

I
have
never
had
cheescake
like
this
.

Yes
,
the
prices
are
high
,
but
I
felt
it
was
worth
it
.

LLOOVVE
THIS
PLACE
.

After
all
that
,
they
complained
to
me
about
the
small
tip
.

Its
dark
,
and
cozy
..
there
is
always
jazz
music
playing
when
we
go
.

The
food
was
bland
oily
.

Fine
,
I
wont
hang
you
for
that
.

I
will
not
go
back
.

Also
have
great
margaritas
!

Your
friends
will
thank
you
for
introducing
them
to
this
gem
!

Also
,
they
serve
THE
best
hummus
in
America
,
with
a
drizzle
of
fragrant
olive
oil
(
which
,
I
believe
is
the
traditional
way
)
!

It
is
not
worth
going
at
all
and
spend
your
money
there
!
!
!

No
gimmicks
here
-
-
the
food
speaks
for
itself
in
its
freshness
and
preparation
.

He
served
me
an
Uni
Hand
roll
,
which
I
never
had
before
,
and
let
me
tell
you
...
IT
WAS
HEAVEN
!

The
waiter
delivered
our
food
while
holding
what
appeared
to
be
a
plastic
bag
of
garbage
in
one
hand
.

Terrible
would
be
a
compliment
!

None
that
I
can
think
of
.

We
ordered
some
beef
and
noodle
soup
dishes
from
the
Thai
section
of
the
menu
but
nothing
we
got
was
Thai
.

MMmmm
...
it
was
delicious
.

I
liked
it
.

The
food
is
good
,
especially
their
more
basic
dishes
,
and
the
drinks
are
delicious
.

This
place
was
reccomended
to
me
by
a
friend
.

I
hope
one
day
Scooner
or
Later
returns
to
what
it
once
was
.

If
it
seemed
possible
to
do
so
while
there
I
would
have
fought
my
bill
since
my
dinner
portion
of
my
meal
was
inedible
!

Mediocre
food

I
noice
most
reviews
mention
the
bad
service
.

There
are
many
Thai
places
in
the
city
but
so
far
Toons
is
#
1
.

It's
fresh
,
welcoming
,
delicious
,
and
relaxing
.

I
come
here
enjoy
very
much
with
husband
.

The
worst
excuse
for
Japanese
food
I've
ever
encountered
.

One
of
my
favorite
places
in
Brooklyn
.

Stay
away

short
and
sweet
–
seating
is
great
:
it's
romantic
,
cozy
and
private
.

You
won
’
t
be
disappointed
by
their
menu
.

Went
for
Mom's
birthday
brunch
/
lunch
.

None
was
made
so
i
hung
up
.

The
staff
is
pretty
friendly
.

They're
rude
at
times
,
and
not
very
friendly
.

I
thought
the
restaurant
was
nice
and
clean
.

but
ive
heard
a
lot
about
this
for
the
past
2
yrs
and
finally
decided
to
eat
here
.

1
o'clock
in
the
morning
.

Definately
check
it
out
!
!
!

Even
then
,
the
order
was
not
correct
and
we
were
still
waiting
for
a
couple
items
.

The
specialty
here
is
decadent
pancakes
,
but
I've
been
back
now
four
times
,
and
I've
been
wowed
every
time
.

One
of
my
favorite
places
in
Manhattan
.

Aside
from
the
Sea
Urchin
,
the
chef
recommended
an
assortment
of
fish
including
Fatty
Yellow
Tail
,
Boton
Shrimp
,
Blue
Fin
Torro
(
Fatty
Tuna
)
,
Sea
Eel
,
etc
.

Green
tea
creme
brulee
gets
better
each
time
I
have
it
.

I
like
the
somosas
,
chai
,
and
the
chole
,
but
the
dhosas
and
dhal
were
kinda
dissapointing
.

Service
-
friendly
and
attentive
.

When
the
bill
came
,
nothing
was
comped
,
so
I
told
the
manager
very
politely
that
we
were
willing
to
pay
for
the
wine
,
but
I
didn't
think
I
should
have
to
pay
for
food
with
a
maggot
in
it
.

amazing
fresh
dogs
but
best
of
all
endless
toppings
!
!
!

We
will
return
many
times
for
this
oasis
in
mid-town
.

This
place
has
great
indian
chinese
food
.

And
evaluated
on
those
terms
Pastis
is
simply
wonderful
.

Great
food
,
good
size
menu
,
great
service
and
an
unpretensious
setting
.

Fantastic
!

Too
bad
Latin
Quarters
closed
.

Obviously
the
Chinese
translation
of
this
place
does
not
mean
Big
Wong
,
it
actually
means
Great
Prosperity
.

HAVE
NEVER

HAD
SUCH
AN
UNPLEASANT
EXPERIENCE
.

I
FOUND
A
NEW

ON
SECOND

!
!
!

The
food
here
was
mediocre
at

.

HIGHLY
RECOMMENDED
!
!
!

Best
restaurant
in
Brooklyn

Love
it
every
time

They
don't
concern
much
of
customer's
health
,
just
want
to
make
money
.

Great
staff
.

Won't
or
Can't
is
not
in
the
service
directory
.

I
absolutely
Loved
this
place
.

The
best
dish
are
the
honwy
walnut
prawns
-
just
outstanding
.

Great
food
.

You
can
get
a
table
without
a
reservation
if
you
get
there
early
I
they
don't
make
you
by
bottles
.

They
tell
me
they
are
going
to
cover
the
garden
in
glass
for
the
winter
,
so
i'm
looking
forward
to
going
there
on
a
snowy
night
to
enjoy
it
.

Small
,
bright
,
and
clean
,
BZ
Grill
stands
apart
from
the
usual
run
of
gyro
joints
,
both
in
Astoria
and
out
.

–
Where
can
I
begin
.

I
highly
recommend
the
Sophia
pizza
.

We
both
opted
for
a
pasta
dish
and
they
were
served
timely
and
fresh
.

Have
the
iced
tea
.

It
is
so
romantic
.

Normally
,
places
ask
how
hot
you
want
it
,
but
they
didn't
.

The
dishes
came
out
around
5
minutes
apart
.

This
place
is
not
worth
the
prices
.

The
decor
is
vibrant
and
eye-pleasing
with
several
semi-private
boths
on
the
right
side
of
the
dining
hall
,
which
are
great
for
a
date
.

Lebanese
Food
!
Yum
!

it
is
sad
there
is
not
many
people
who
frequent
eating
at
places
like
these
that
look
pricey
because
they
are
at
the
hotel
...
but
they
are
definitely
one
you
dont
want
to
miss
,
esp
if
your
in
downtown
san
jose
.

Way
below
average

I
definitely
wouldn't
go
back
.

If
you
like
spicy
food
get
the
chicken
vindaloo
.

I'm
sure
I'll
return
for
a
final
judgement
tho
.

I
had
the
Lamb
special
which
was
perfect
.

I
started
out
with
a
Bombay
beer
which
was
big
enough
for
two
.

The
food
was
great
and
tasty
,
but
the
sitting
space
was
too
small
,
I
don't
like
being
cramp
in
a
corner
.

Better
than
the
bagel
shop
on
the
corner
,
but
not
worth
going
out
of
your
way
for
,
in
my
opinion
.

I
love
it
.

Go

California

Stepping
into

last
night
was
a
true

any

!

Chintzy
portions

Great
food
,
spectacular
location
,
and
friendly
service
keep
us
coming
back
year
after
year
.

Everything
was
wonderful
;
food
,
drinks
,
staff
,
mileau
.

Food
was
OK
.

Everything
,
and
I
mean
everything
on
the
menu
is
delectable
.

Great
bagels
made
the
old-fashioned
way
.

Wonderful
at
holiday
time
.

I
do
not
recommend
.

There
were
3
bottles
of
perfume
on
the
sink
and
the
line
of
girls
trying
to
use
the
sink
.

Don't
dine
at
Tamarind
for
the
vegetarian
dishes
,
they
are
simply
not
up
to
par
with
the
non-veg
selections
.

I
cannot
imagine
a
friendlier
staff
working
in
a
restaurant
.

you
know
what
i
mean
all
the
positives
things
happening
there
made
mw
write
this
review
.

Love
the
enchiladas
and
chicken
soup
-
and
be
sure
to
check
out
their
specials
.

Always
busy
but
fast
moving
.

There
was
a
small
wait
,
but
shorter
than
I
expected
.

the
all-u-can-eat
sushi
is
definitely
in
very
poor
quality
.

Went
there
with
my
wife
and
we
had
to
wait
for
a
table
even
though
you
could
see
there
many
that
were
empty
with
not
reservation
sigh
on
them
.

I
also
really
enjoy
the
simplicity
of
the
decor
and
intimate
feeling
of
a
small
restaurant
.

I
read
reviews
that
called
the
restaurant
too
expensive
and
I
thought
to
myself
,
but
may
be
it
is
worth
it
.

This
place
is
so
much
fun
.

The
space
is
limited
so
be
prepared
to
wait
up
to
45
minutes
-
1
hour
,
but
be
richly
rewarded
when
you
savor
the
delicious
indo-chinese
food
.

Will
not
be
back
.

The
waiter
was
attentive
,
the
food
was
delicious
and
the
views
of
the
city
were
great
.

–
First
of
all
,
I
am
not
from
Long
Beach
.

Decor
needs
to
be
upgraded
but
the
food
is
amazing
!

over
.

Loved
it

HOWEVER
,
one
Sunday
afternoon
my
husband
and
I
did
go
(
although
with
my
loud
protests
)
and
were
pleasantly
surprised
.

you
should
travel
from
the
Bronx
to
try
it
...

Indo
Chinese
food
,
pretty
good
...

We
were
drawn
into
the
belly
dancing
show
that
captivated
the
crowd
.

The
food
is
good
.

It's
located
in
a
strip
mall
near
the
Beverly
Center
,
not
the
greatest
location
,
but
the
food
keeps
me
coming
back
for
more
.

Try
their
chef's
specials
-
-
they
are
to
die
for
.

So
I
decide
to
report
back
to
the
waitress
because
it
was
completely
inedible
.

The
staff
was
really
friendly
.

Our
first
time
in
New
York
and
we
had
to
try
a
New
York
Bagel
.

I
LOOOVE
their
eggplant
pizza
,
as
well
as
their
pastas
!

Also
love
their
caeser
salad
.

We
asked
for
beverages
and
never
received
them
.

Not
only
can
the
selection
be
innovative
,
but
there's
a
nice
balance
of
traditional
sushi
as
well
.

They
were
served
warm
and
had
a
soft
fluffy
interior
.

First
went
here
to
enjoy
their
garden
terrace
.

I
tend
to
judge
a
sushi
restaurant
by
its
sea
urchin
,
which
was
heavenly
at
sushi
rose
.

We
were
walking
around
the
village
and
went
into
this
place
just
for
some
drinks
.

Wretched
and
retching

The
house
special
roll
is
really
good
.

No
plans
to
return
anytime
soon
.

Definitely
a
neighborhood
favorite
.

Our
drinks
kept
coming
but
our
server
came
by
a
couple
times
.

Chicken
teriyaki
had
tomato
or
pimentos
on
top
?
?

.
Please
don't
tell
anyone
in
my
family
i
eat
there
.

mouth
.

Stuffing
yourself
with
Japanese
food
is
a
rare
thing
.

I've
enjoyed
99
%
of
the
dishes
we've
ordered
with
the
only
exceptions
being
the
occasional
too-authentic-for-me
dish
(
I'm
a
daring
eater
but
not
THAT
daring
)
.

Just
go
there
and
see
for
yourself
.

As
BFC
doesn't
take
reservations
you
almost
always
have
to
wait
by
the
bar
-
and
be
abused
by
the
front
of
house
staff
until
you
are
seated
,
which
can
be
over
an
hour
later
!

I
lived
in
Maine
for
ten
years
and
grew
up
on
fish
.

This
is
a
nice
restaurant
if
you
are
looking
for
a
good
place
to
host
an
intimate
dinner
meeting
with
business
associates
.

The
food
was
good
.

–
they
have
4
locations
.

One
of
the
best
hot
dogs
I
have
ever
eaten
.

Delicious

Everytime
I
decide
to
try
another
place
on
the
UES
,
I
get
angry
that
I
didn't
just
go
to
Zucchero
Pomodori
.

My
mom
originally
introduced
me
to
this
place
,
but
even
she
(
being
Indian
)
feels
the
food
can
be
somewhat
over
the
top
spicy
and
far
too
oily
.

They
are
not
helpful
in
the
least
and
will
give
you
the
grand
run
around
so
by
the
time
the
event
date
rolls
around
you
will
not
only
regret
chosing
this
place
,
but
also
become
hostile
!

Overall
the
restaurant
is
more
expensive
than
our
other
sushi
favorites
,
but
everything
was
delicious
.

The
food
was
authentic
.

I
visit
New
Green
Bo
when
I
have
money
or
when
I
am
broke
.

A
little
overpriced
but
worth
it
once
you
take
a
bite
.

You
are
likely
to
be
disappointed
.

If
you
’
re
planning
to
come
here
,
make
sure
that
your
date
is
someone
whom
you
really
like
since
you
’
ll
be
ushered
to
private
booths
where
there
will
be
no
people
or
food
watching
(
choose
the
ones
on
the
ground
level
that
have
glass
ceilings
so
you
may
see
the
stars
in
the
sky
!
)
.

The
pizza
was
delivered
cold
and
the
cheese
wasn't
even
fully
melted
!

We've
lived
around
the
corner
from
this
place
for
over
a
year
and
finally
had
dinner
there
.

The
bar
is
very
well
stocked
with
interesting
beers
and
well
priced
wines
.

–
I
don't
understand
how
I
was
a
stranger
to
this
place
for
so
long
...
the
fajita
salad
,
the
colorado
,
the
fajitas
-
EVERYTHING
is
delicious
.

And
they
packaged
everything
nicely
so
it
didn't
spill
.

the
bestt
!

Prices
are
in
line
.

No
Comparison

I
felt
ackward
and
next
time
went
to
the
casino
bathroom
.

The
dosas
are
skimpy
,
unattractive
and
drip
with
grease
,
and
personally
I'd
drink
popcorn
topping
before
I'd
eat
another
one
of
these
.

Everything
we
had
was
good
or
ok
...
but
definitely
nothing
great
.

When
we
stumbled
on
Leon
,
we
thought
that
we
had
found
quite
the
gem
BUT
,
we
were
certainly
wrong
.

Still
we
keep
going
back
:)

The
food
is
very
good
,
but
not
outstanding
.

I've
been
there
three
times
and
have
always
had
wonderful
experiences
.

Great
Hot
Dogs
!

In
an
area
sadly
lacking
in
decent
Thai
food
,
this
is
one
of
the
best
spots
.

Enjoyed
the
food

absolutely
fabulous
!
!
!

Mermaid
Inn
is
an
overall
good
restaurant
with
really
good
seafood
.

This
is
right
up
there
with
places
in
Tokyo
as
far
as
the
freshness
is
concerned
.

Best
Indian
Chinese
in
the
city
,
by
far
!

Never
fails
to
please
.

Best
Sushi
in
town
.

Have
eaten
at
Ginger
House
several
times
,
and
it's
always
good
.

Leave
room
for
dessert
.

Spreads
and
toppings
are
great
-
though
a
bit
pricey
.

I
plan
on
stopping
by
next
week
as
well
.

When
I
walked
in
,
I
was
taken
aback
by
their
incredible
wood
decor
.

My
party
of
two
was
feeling
particularly
ambitious
,
and
we
splurged
on
the
Shilshole
Sampler
...
a
beautiful
assortment
of
enormous
white
gulf
prawns
,
smoked
albacore
tuna
,
Ray's
fantastic
manila
clams
seasoned
with
dill
,
scallops
in
a
tasty
soy
dressing
,
and
a
tiny
pile
of
Dungeness
crab
atop
a
sublime
butter
sauce
.

Drinks
were
good
.

The
food
and
service
were
fine
,
however
the
maitre-D
was
incredibly
unwelcoming
and
arrogant
.

Beef
noodle
soup
is
good
as
well
.

Snooze
provided
an
inventive
pancake
offering
,
but
Le
Peep
would
have
provided
better
service
and
quality
.

The
bagels
always
warm
,
soft
on
the
inside
,
crispy
on
the
outside
and
enormous
in
size
.

The
chana
masala
(
garbanzo
beans
)
are
also
excellent
.

My
friends
settled
for
rice
dishes
,
but
we
came
back
the
following
day
to
try
the
dim
sum
,
which
was
good
...
not
outstanding
,
but
good
.

Will
never
be
back
.

–
Mioposto
has
a
very
creative
&
delicious
pizza
menu
.

The
service
is
fantastic
at
this
fun
place
.

Our
server
continued
to
be
attentive
throughout
the
night
,
but
I
did
remain
puzzled
by
one
issue
:
Who
thinks
that
Ray's
is
an
appropriate
place
to
take
young
children
for
dinner
?

Overall
,
decent
food
at
a
good
price
,
with
friendly
people
.

The
dinner
was
ok
,
nothing
I
would
have
again
.

I
love
breakfast
here
.

Vanison
was
good
but
not
amazing
.

Fantastic
place
.

I
asked
the
chef
what
he
recommends
and
he
asked
me
if
I
like
Uni
.
(

The
hot
dogs
are
top
notch
,
and
they're
Slamwich
is
amazing
!

This
is
a
twenty-something
guy
that
doesn't
mind
laying
down
$
300
for
a
fine
and
delicious
meal
for
2
on
special
occassions
.

The
food
was
not
fresh
,
the
sauces
were
bland
and
very
oily
.

It's
a
great
place
to
enjoy
food
and
meet
friends
.

But
$
1
for
each
small
piece
?
?
?

The
prices
were
CHEAP
compared
to
the
quality
of
service
and
food
.

Will
prob
.
not
return
but
it
is
a
great
dinning
experience
to
try
atleast
once
.

Ruth
,
mother
of
the
Bride

If
you
are
the
type
of
person
who
likes
being
scared
and
entertained
,
this
is
a
great
place
to
go
and
eat
.

Seriously
,
you
can't
go
wrong
,
if
it
is
unpretentious
local
fun
you
seek
.

Hey
,
I
think
$
2
+
for
a
5
block
walk
ain't
bad
.

After
sitting
there
with
my
empty
glass
for
over
20
minutes
I
left
.

Groovy
music
made
the
dinner
casual
.

Polite
acknowledgement
is
out
;

It's
a
little
out
of
our
price
range
for
dining
there
except
on
special
occasions
,
but
we've
eaten
there
6
times
in
the
last
2
years
.

Service
ok
but
unfriendly
,
filthy
bathroom
.

The
cold
appetizer
dishes
taste
like
the
way
I
remember
them
to
taste
when
I
was
growing
up
in
Taiwan
.

There
was
a
really
nice
vibe
about
the
place
...
good
music
,
atmosphere
and
happy
looking
people
.

Wasn't
going
to
share
but
I
feel
obligated
...
while
sitting
at
the
sushi
bar
dining
we
watched
the
chef
accidentally
drop
a
piece
of
Unagi
on
the
floor
and
upon
retrieving
it
from
the
floor
proceed
to
use
the
piece
in
the
delivery
order
he
was
preparing
.

However
,
our
$
14
drinks
were
were
horrible
!

Moderate
prices
.

Personally
I
like
the
margherita
pizza
better
,
but
they
are
all
good
.

Save
room
for
scrumptious
desserts
.

We
all
ordered
different
entrees
so
we
could
share
.

A
different
server
enhanced
the
fun
,
dumping
our
entrees
in
front
of
us
halfway
through
our
appetizer
(
which
was
delicious
)
.

They
have
a
wide
variety
of
fish
and
they
even
list
which
oceans
they
come
from
;
Atlantic
or
Pacific
.

I
waited
for
10-15
minutes
for
service
ordered
a
beer
&
was
never
served
again
.

I
have
eaten
at
some
of
the
'
best
'
sushi
joints
in
NYC
(
Nobu
,
Bond
Street
,
JewelBako
,
etc
)
and
Yamato
is
my
favorite
.

It's
somewhere
you
can
eat
and
be
happy
.

Should
check-up
on
us
more
frequently
,
don't
you
think
?

Not
a
great
place
for
family
or
general
dining
.

I've
had
my
fair
share
of
modern
Japanese
and
this
spot
delivers
.

BUt
once
done
,
it's
not
too
much
dough
,
not
too
much
cheese
,
not
too
much
sauce
.

We
waited
at
the
bar
and
had
martinis
that
were
just
right
.

I
came
here
with
my
boyfriend
for
our
anniversary
because
it
was
highly
recommended
to
him
by
a
friend
.

–
IT
CANT
GET
ANY
BETTER
!
!
!

The
sushi
seemed
pretty
fresh
and
was
adequately
proportioned
.

so
about
the
prawns
,
they
were
fresh
and
had
a
slight
crispiness
about
the
batter
...
soooo
good
...
the
walnuts
were
cut
in
smaller
pieces
and
very
crunchy
and
tasty
.

A
big
disappointment
,
all
around
.

They
have
a
delicious
banana
chocolate
dessert
,
as
well
as
a
great
green
tea
tempura
.

even
the
wine
by
the
glass
was
good
.

Authentic
Taiwanese
food
that's
cheap
...
what
more
could
you
ask
for
?

The
food
is
great
and
they
have
a
good
selecion
of
wines
at
reasonable
prices
.

While
finishing
our
meals
which
included
a
high-end
bottle
of
wine
,
our
son's
fiance
joined
us
for
a
glass
of
wine
and
dessert
.

$
170
down
the
toilet
...

amazing
fun
for
hot
dog
lovers
of
all
ages
PLEASE
do
yourself
a
favor
and
check
this
place
out
!
!
!

My
boyfriend
had
the
New
England
Chowder
it
was
good
but
I
think
the
award
should
go
to
the
Lobster
Bisque
.

The
manager
was
rude
and
handled
the
situation
extremely
poorly
.

You'll
be
ther
for
every
anniversary
,
birthday
,
valentines
day
...

The
quantity
is
also
very
good
,
you
will
come
out
satisfied
.

Save
yourself
the
time
and
trouble
and
skip
this
one
!

Try
everything
for
that
matter
,
it
is
all
good
.

We
thought
that
this
place
is
using
too
much
of
MSG
cooking
in
the
foods
.

Okay-i
don't
mind
the
oily
part
(
cause
most
are
cooked
that
way
)
but
it
was
way
too
bland
.

we
are
for
sure
coming
back
to
this
restaurant
.

Service
is
not
what
you
are
coming
here
for
...

I
got
the
shellfish
and
shrimp
appetizer
and
it
was
alright
.

I've
eaten
at
Pizza
Gruppo
a
few
times
,
but
more
often
I
order
delivery
.

I
was
very
disappointed
with
this
restaurant
.

The
food
is
great
.

My
wife
and
I
visited
Dokebi
tonight
.

They
should
have
called
it
mascarpone
with
chocolate
chips-good
but
a
far
cry
from
what
the
name
implies
.

I
took
my
boyfriend
for
a
dinner
on
saturday
night
.

There
is
a
lot
of
variety
even
for
people
who
eat
vegetarian
like
me
.

Faan
is
sooo
good
.

I
ordered
the
smoked
salmon
and
roe
appetizer
and
it
was
off
flavor
.

I
should
have
just
asked
for
the
check
when
I
saw
that
;
but
their
menu
was
so
unique
that
I
continued
.

The
place
was
quiet
and
delightful
.

I
went
there
2times
.

Portions
was
just
enough
for
me
,
but
may
not
be
for
a
big
eater
.

The
DJ
is
awesome
,
I
have
been
there
for
my
birthday
and
a
bunch
of
other
times
with
friends
and
I
keep
going
back
.

The
food
is
authentic
Italian
-
delicious
!

This
place
is
really
trendi
but
they
have
forgotten
about
the
most
important
part
of
a
restaurant
,
the
food
.

If
we
were
to
move
from
the
upper
east
side
,
we
would
genuinely
miss
this
restaurant
.

I
went
there
with
some
friends
one
night
to
play
bingo
and
watch
the
sox
game
and
it
was
a
blast
!

Planet
Thai
is
great
!

–
We
were
treated
very
rudely
here
one
time
for
breakfast
.

–
I've
been
to
over
a
dozen
Indian
places
in
L
.
A
.
,
and
this
is
still
my
favorite
.

Possibly
the
Most
Romantic
Restaurant
in
the
City

Yeah
the
crowd
can
take
it
a
bit
seriously
,
but
it
shouldn't
.

Best
Reuben
sandwich
ever
!

I
/
we
will
never
go
back
to
this
place
again
.

You
are
bound
to
have
a
very
charming
time
.

–
This
is
one
of
my
top
lunch
spots
,
huge
portions
,
fast
service
and
amazing
margaritas
!
!

My
party
had
the
BBE
$
29
fixe
prix
menu
,
which
was
such
a
wonderful
deal
since
it
also
came
with
a
flight
of
sake
!

My
girlfiends
and
I
ate
at
O
.
G
.
again
last
night
.

I'm
not
sure
where
the
other
reviewers
ate
but
it
seems
as
if
we
visited
two
different
restaurants
because
my
friends
and
I
all
enjoy
Mizu
very
much
...
and
we're
repeat
customers
.

BEST
DINING
EXPERIENCE
IN
THE
WEST
VILLAGE
!

great
food

The
food
was
excellent
as
well
as
service
,
however
,
I
left
The
Four
Seasons
very
dissappointed
.

That
was
the
last
night
in
Vegas
and
was
too
late
and
most
of
the
restaurant
were
closing
-
so
we
walked
in
the
check
the
place
.

The
people
that
work
there
are
always
so
friendly
you
forget
you
are
in
New
York
sometimes
.

Fresh
ingrediants
and
super
tasty
.

I
found
it
on
a
cold
night
,
the
perfect
spot
to
warm
up
.

Maybe
it
is
good
for
that
one
night
once
in
a
blue
moon
when
the
chefs
decide
to
use
fish
that's
half-way
decent
.

I
come
from
a
family
of
pizzeria
owners
,
and
I'm
almost
ashamed
to
say
that
the
pizza
in
Fornino's
blows
my
families
receipies
away
.

The
seats
are
uncomfortable
if
you
are
sitting
against
the
wall
on
wooden
benches
.

I
highly
recommend
the
restaurant
based
on
our
experience
last
night
.

My
only
negative
comment
is
that
I
wish
the
pieces
were
a
little
bigger
.

I
may
not
be
a
sushi
guru
but
I
can
tell
you
that
the
food
here
is
just
okay
and
that
there
is
not
much
else
to
it
.

Ravioli
was
good
...
but
I
have
to
say
that
I
found
everything
a
bit
overpriced
.

A
gentleman
,
maybe
the
manager
,
came
to
our
table
,
and
without
so
much
as
a
smile
or
greeting
asked
for
our
order
.

I
like
Cafe
Noir
dont
get
me
wrong
,
it
is
jsut
that
the
people
who
work
there
are
evil
and
incompetent
!
!

Truly
the
mark
of
an
attentive
waiter
.

They
were
very
abrupt
with
me
when
I
called
and
actually
claimed
the
food
was
late
because
they
were
out
of
rice
.

The
chicken
curry
and
chicken
tikka
masala
are
my
favorite
meat
dishes
.

The
have
over
100
different
beers
to
offer
thier
guest
so
that
made
my
husband
very
happy
and
the
food
was
delicious
,
if
I
must
recommend
a
dish
it
must
be
the
pumkin
tortelini
.

I
wasn't
thrilled
to
have
to
wait
on
line
for
thirty
minutes
,
but
I
guess
that's
the
price
you
pay
for
a
popular
place
.

Taxan
delicious
!

Authentic
Korean
food
lovers
should
visit
32nd
Street
,
of
course
.

Well
I
guess
it's
hard
to
be
seated
when
one
is
invisible
to
the
staff
.

great
service
.

Just
want
to
warn
you
all
-
don't
waste
your
time
and
money
.

I
went
here
for
a
family
birthday
dinner
.

This
place
is
worth
an
one-hour
drive
.

We
called
the
other
person
who
was
very
close
by
,
and
she
told
us
to
order
for
her
,
so
we
did
.

It's
just
the
right
size
for
the
menu
.

We
are
very
particular
about
sushi
and
were
both
please
with
every
choice
which
included
:
ceviche
mix
(
special
)
,
crab
dumplings
,
assorted
sashimi
,
sushi
and
rolls
,
two
types
of
sake
,
and
the
banana
tempura
.

yummy
.

I
attended
a
holiday
dinner
at
the
restaurant
,
and
the
food
was
majorly
disappointing
.

it
gets
really
busy
,
so
get
there
on
the
early
side
so
you
can
grab
a
seat
,
if
you
do
have
to
wait
,
its
not
bad
because
the
service
is
quick
!

Downtown
Dinner
2002
-
Prixe
fix
:
Appetizers
were
ok
,
waiter
gave
me
poor
suggestion
..
try
the
potato
stuff
kanish
best
one
.

The
service
is
ok
,
some
of
the
people
didn't
get
what
they
asked
for
.

A
perfect
place
to
take
out
of
town
guests
any
time
of
the
year
.

I've
had
the
Jellyfish
,
Horse
Mackerel
,
Blue
Fin
Tuna
and
the
Sake
Ikura
roll
among
others
,
and
they
were
all
good
.

The
characters
really
make
for
an
enjoyable
experience
.

This
place
is
a
great
bargain
.

The
outdoor
atmosphere
of
sitting
on
the
sidewalk
watching
the
world
go
by
50
feet
away
on
6th
avenue
on
a
cool
evening
was
wonderful
.

How
is
this
palce
still
open
?

All
their
menu
items
are
a
hit
,
and
they
serve
mimosas
.

To
their
credit
they
removed
the
dish
from
the
check
;
but
no
manager
stopped
by
to
ask
what
the
problem
was
.

Had
an
awful
experience
at
Casa
la
Femme
on
a
Saturday
dinner
.

Food
was
good
and
the
view
of
the
new
york
city
skiline
was
terrific
even
on
a
foggy
rainy
day
like
that
of
when
I
went
.

Great
bottle
of
wine
.

I
recieved
prompt
service
with
a
smile
.

The
food
they
serve
is
not
comforting
,
not
appetizing
and
uncooked
.

then
we
ordered
a
dinosaur
rolls
and
white
tuna
sashimi
.

Watch
the
talented
belly
dancers
as
you
enjoy
delicious
baba
ganoush
that's
more
lemony
than
smoky
.

THE
BIG
COMPLAINT
:
NO
TOASTING
AVAILABLE
.

Seafood
Plus

–
Pretty
cheap
for
sit
down
Mexican
AND
downtown
.

But
they
do
.

The
place
is
small
and
cramped
but
the
food
is
fantastic
.

I
noticed
alot
of
indian
people
eatting
there
which
is
a
great
sign
for
an
indian
place
!

I
would
highly
recommand
requesting
a
table
by
the
window
.

The
combination
of
super-fresh
ingredients
in
the
dishes
are
unusual
but
really
delicious
.

My
boyfriend
asked
me
if
I
wanted
to
switch
and
eat
his
salmon
instead
,
while
he
de-skinned
the
chicken
so
that
I
could
enjoy
the
white
meat
.

Overpriced

When
I
got
there
the
place
was
packed
but
they
made
sure
to
seat
me
quickly
.

There
is
no
excuse
for
such
lousy
service
!

The
scallops
are
apparently
cooked
in
a
black
olive
butter
which
really
makes
them
unique
(
not
to
mention
tasty
)
.

You
can't
say
its
cheap
because
food
is
cheaper
in
Chinatown
.

We
easily
spent
more
than
$
40
per
person
(
not
including
alcohol
)
and
were
still
hungry
.

It
is
a
lot
of
fun
with
live
entertainment
and
all
kinds
of
Disney
type
special
effects
.

Their
bagels
are
fine
,
but
they
are
a
little
overcooked
,
and
not
really
a
'
special
'
bagel
experience
.

Great
spot
,
whether
looking
for
a
couple
of
drinks
or
quiet
dinner
.

The
svc
can
be
a
bit
rude
at
times
,
esp
if
you
have
big
group
,
but
overall
the
restaurant
is
a
must
!

Great
food
,
great
prices
,
great
service
.

Someone
else
recommended
the
dessert
-
we
also
left
that
.

Finally
,
my
wife
stood
face
to
face
in
front
of
one
of
the
staff
and
she
asked
,
"
Are
you
waiting
for
a
table
?
"

Good
,
fast
service
.

less
wait
time
for
me
!

I
was
looking
for
banana
tempura
for
dessert
and
they
dont
have
.

I'm
a
born
and
bred
Southend
resident
and
was
excited
to
hear
of
this
restaurant
opening
.

The
wine
list
is
also
really
nice
.

Dumbfoundingly
Poor

Warning
:
You
may
find
it
difficult
to
dine
at
other
Japanese
restaurants
after
a
visit
to
Mizu
!

We
were
seated
right
away
,
the
table
was
private
and
nice
.

I
love
sushi
,
and
I
have
eaten
it
all
over
the
world
.

For
those
that
go
once
and
don't
enjoy
it
,
all
I
can
say
is
that
they
just
don't
get
it
.

it's
a
perfect
place
to
have
a
amanzing
indian
food
.

Everything
I
had
was
good
,
and
I'm
a
eater
.

It
is
obvious
that
no
one
in
the
restaurant
has
any
idea
about
or
experience
with
Japanese
cuisine
.

They
were
such
a
rip-off
(
$
8.95
for
four
small
meat
patties
in
steamed
buns
)
and
not
worth
trying
.

Not
worth
it
.

The
hostess
said
"
Wow
that's
a
large
group
,
unless
you
aren't
together
"
,
to
which
I
replied
"
no
we
are
,
and
there
will
be
one
more
,
so
a
table
for
six
please
.
"

Servers
are
all
different
,
Greg
is
my
favorite
.

The
only
thing
you
can
do
here
is
walk
in
and
eat
..
but
planning
an
event
,
especially
a
small
,
intimate
one
,
forget
about
it
.

Service
was
slow
had
to
wait
to
order
and
get
food
although
not
crowded
.

We
were
very
disappointed
.

The
reason
there
are
4
different
results
on
citysearch
for
the
same
place
is
because
they
keep
trying
to
start
a
new
thread
so
they
can
stock
it
with
positive
reviews
.

Given
that
Ray's
is
a
seafood
restaurant
...
well
,
you
get
the
idea
...

We
were
planning
to
get
dessert
but
the
waitress
basically
through
the
bill
at
us
before
we
had
a
chance
to
order
.

The
ambiance
was
a
peaceful
and
relaxing
break
amongst
all
the
kids
running
around
in
Downtown
Disney
.

The
restaurant
was
80
%
full
and
there
was
a
sign
posted
"
wait
to
be
seated
.
"

BUT
not
in
a
good
way
.

good
music
,
great
food
,
speedy
service
affordable
prices
.

I
don't
know
if
I'll
be
back
...

After
hearing
a
lot
of
great
things
about
the
restaurant
,
and
passing
by
it
on
a
daily
basis
,
we
decided
to
try
.

I
don't
think
I
would
go
again
.

You
can
order
to
go
if
you
have
to
get
back
to
the
office
too
!

I
have
never
eaten
in
the
restaurant
,
however
,
upon
reading
the
reviews
I
got
take
out
last
week
.

The
food
is
so
cheap
and
the
waiters
are
nice
.

I
can't
!
!
!

The
wife
had
the
risotto
which
was
amazing
.

It
may
be
a
bit
packed
on
weekends
,
but
the
vibe
is
good
and
it
is
the
best
French
food
you
will
find
in
the
area
.

–
...
and
the
best
summertime
deck
experience--they
will
even
bring
you
a
blanket
if
you
get
cold
in
the
Seattle
evening
weather
.

I
have
been
to
Rao's
probably
15
times
the
past
3
years
and
it
keeps
getting
better
.

The
only
positive
thing
about
Mioposto
is
the
nice
location
.

However
,
our
main
course
was
wonderful
.

Never
again
!

Their
specialty
rolls
are
impressive
,
though
I
can't
remember
what
we
had
.

The
ambience
was
so
fun
,
and
the
prices
were
great
,
on
top
of
the
fact
that
the
food
was
really
tasty
.

The
seafood
is
amazing
,
there's
a
good
wine
list
,
and
the
ever-changing
menu
always
offers
some
great
surprises
.

I
will
be
going
back
very
soon
.

The
have
a
great
cocktail
with
Citrus
Vodka
and
lemon
and
lime
juice
and
mint
leaves
that
is
to
die
for
!

The
food
was
mediocre
at
best
but
it
was
the
horrible
service
that
made
me
vow
never
to
go
back
.

I
really
loved
the
different
and
inovated
touch
that's
the
cheff
gives
to
the
food
.

We
did
tip
,
I
guess
the
model
/
waitress
just
wanted
more
and
complained
to
the
manager
.

The
food
is
flavorful
,
plentiful
and
reasonably
priced
.

So
,
I
switch
with
my
boyfriend
again
to
see
if
maybe
I
could
stomach
the
meat
and
spinach
again
,
but
the
spinach
was
so
undercooked
that
I
just
could
not
bite
through
it
.

Some
Pineapple
covered
in
a
glaze
of
some
kind
and
some
pear
tart
thing
Not
impressive
at
all
.

plenty
of
food
,
trust
me
.

Thank
you

–
My
family
went
on
a
midweek
evening
to
have
dinner
.

I
am
relatively
new
to
the
area
and
tried
Pick
a
bgel
on
2nd
and
was
disappointed
with
the
service
and
I
thought
the
food
was
overated
and
on
the
pricey
side
.

But
the
pizza
is
way
to
expensive
.

A
great
place
to
meet
up
for
some
food
and
drinks
...

Go
hungry
and
enjoy
.

–
Every
neighborhood
has
a
few
great
local
bars
that
are
the
best
secrets
.

Go
with
some
friends
,
wait
the
half
hour
or
so
with
a
cup
of
joe
,
and
enjoy
more
than
your
average
breakfast
.

I
love
this
place

Maybe
it
has
improved
since
then
?

When
we
inquired
about
ports
-
the
waitress
listed
off
several
but
did
not
know
taste
variations
or
cost
.

The
mussles
were
the
fishiest
things
I've
ever
tasted
,
the
seabass
was
bland
,
the
goat
cheese
salad
was
missing
the
goat
cheese
,
the
penne
w
/
chicken
had
bones
in
it
...
It
was
disgusting
.

I
grew
up
on
these
bagels
.

The
food
however
,
is
what
one
might
expect
.

Eat
at
your
own
risk
.

This
is
the
first
place
I've
been
that
a
runner
remembers
my
order
...
hope
he
likes
his
job
because
I
have
half
a
mind
to
steal
him
for
my
restaurant
.

Well
,
this
place
is
so
Ghetto
its
not
even
funny
.

Prices
are
very
good
.

I
recommend
it
!

I
couldn't
ignore
the
fact
that
she
reach
over
the
plate
of
one
of
my
friends
,
who
was
in
mid
bite
,
to
clear
the
table
.

it
helps
if
you
know
what
to
order
.

Open
late
(
well
as
late
as
I
ever
got
there
and
I'm
a
night
person
)

Look
,
the
appetizers
were
really
good
.

Best
Italian
food
I
ever
had
(
and
being
Italian
,
that
means
alot
)
.

This
place
is
not
inviting
and
the
food
is
totally
weird
.

My
father
had
the
flank
steak
which
was
very
good
,
and
my
mother
had
the
swordfish
.

The
drinks
are
always
welll
made
and
wine
selection
is
fairly
priced
.

it's
the
only
place
you
can
get
yummy
authentic
japanese
comfort
food
.

I
go
here
at
least
once
every
other
week
,
particularly
when
it's
cold
!

Her
review
is
above
.

The
food
is
great
and
they
make
a
mean
bloody
mary
.

–
The
pepperoni's
cut
real
thick--Yum
.

Great
Atmosphere

I
went
to
this
restaurant
with
a
woman
that
I
met
recently
.

enough
said
!

This
place
is
always
very
crowded
and
popular
.

An
excellent
service

Food
was
very
good
,
but
not
what
I
would
consider
out
of
this
world
.

–
Had
to
wait
thirty
minutes
to
get
in
the
door
on
a
tuesday
morning
,
but
it
was
so
worth
it
.

–
Mercedes
restaurant
is
so
tasty
,
the
service
is
undeniably
awesome
!

Serves
really
good
sushi
.

She
replied
"
well
it
would
be
more
convenient
for
us
if
you
ordered
now
,
since
you
are
a
larger
party
,
and
it
might
get
crowded
.
"

Everything
I've
had
here
is
good
,
taco
salads
,
burritos
,
enchiladas
i
love
this
place
.

The
place
is
a
lot
of
fun
.

What
a
find
!

Been
there
lots
since
and
its
always
a
good
time
.

my
favorite
place
lol

good
sake
,
good
food
–
i
honestly
don't
know
much
about
japanese
food
at
all
.

My
wife
and
I
went
to
Water's
Edge
for
a
romantic
dinner
.

great
toppings
definitely
a
place
you
need
to
check
out
for
late
night
munchies
or
a
mid
day
boost
!

I
had
their
eggs
benedict
for
brunch
,
which
were
the
worst
in
my
entire
life
,
I
tried
removing
the
hollondaise
sauce
completely
that
was
how
failed
it
was
.

The
hostess
is
rude
to
the
point
of
being
offensive
.

We
could
have
made
a
meal
of
the
yummy
dumplings
from
the
dumpling
menu
.

the
pad
se
ew
chicken
was
delicious
,
however
the
pad
thai
was
far
too
oily
.

While
their
kitchen
food
is
delicious
,
their
Sushi
is
out
of
this
world
.

I
can't
wait
to
go
back
.

So
rude
!
!
!

Blue
Ribbon
lives
up
to
it's
fantastic
reputation
.

It
is
expensive
but
well
worth
the
money
.

The
hanger
steak
was
like
rubber
and
the
tuna
was
flavorless
not
to
mention
it
tasted
like
it
had
just
been
thawed
.

All
in
all
we're
already
coming
up
with
excuses
to
go
ahead
really
soon
in
the
next
few
wks
!
!
!

Loved
It

Furthermore
,
while
the
fish
is
unquestionably
fresh
,
rolls
tend
to
be
inexplicably
bland
.

Service
was
also
very
good
.

Though
,
one
thing
I
realized
later
on
was
that
the
restaurant
either
used
MSG
or
a
meat
tenderizer
on
the
steak
.

You
cannot
go
wrong
at
the
Red
Eye
Grill
.

noodles
with
shrimp
and
chicken
and
coconut
juice
is
the
MUST
!

I
had
the
duck
breast
special
on
my
last
visit
and
it
was
incredible
.

The
server
was
really
cool
and
served
us
our
food
and
drinks
with
a
smile
.

Check
this
place
out
!

If
you're
in
the
area
you
shouldn't
be
disappointed
.

It
was
steamed
and
tossed
with
garlic
.

And
I've
been
to
many
NYC
delis
.

Not
impressed
with
the
food
.

The
coffe
is
very
good
,
too
.

LOL

It's
to
die
for
!

Go
there
to
relax
and
feel
like
your
somewhere
else
.

JUST
AWSOME
.

A
great
choice
at
any
cost
and
a
great
deal
.

All
in
all
,
I
would
return
-
as
it
was
a
beautiful
restaurant
-
but
I
hope
the
staff
pays
more
attention
to
the
little
details
in
the
future
.

Maggot
in
the
food
!

I
wish
they
would
change
back
to
what
it
was
before
.

We
recently
decided
to
try
this
location
,
and
to
our
delight
,
they
have
outdoor
seating
,
perfect
since
I
had
my
yorkie
with
me
.

they
were
dry
and
disgusting
,
i
didn't
even
finish
my
first
piece
.

Cute
and
decorative
.

No
desert
menu
,
no
apology
,
nothing
!
!
!

This
place
survives
on
reputation
alone
.

Run
don't
walk
.

The
fried
dumplings
are
GREAT
!

I
ate
here
a
week
ago
and
found
most
dishes
average
at
best
and
too
expensive
.

The
food
is
decent
at
best
,
and
the
ambience
,
well
,
it's
a
matter
of
opinion
,
some
may
consider
it
to
be
a
sweet
thing
,
I
thought
it
was
just
annoying
.

Wonderful
strawberry
daiquiries
as
well
!

They
forgot
a
sandwich
,
didn't
include
plastic
forks
,
and
didn't
include
pita
with
the
hummus
platter
.

By
the
time
we
finished
our
dinner
we
still
had
not
received
one
beverage
NOR
hooka
!

If
you
are
looking
for
a
good
quality
,
cheap
eats
-
this
is
the
place
.

every
month
if
possible
.

I
love
Indian
food
and
consider
myself
to
be
quite
an
expert
on
it
.

If
you
don't
mind
pre-sliced
low
quality
fish
,
unfriendly
staff
and
a
sushi
chef
that
looks
like
he
is
miserable
then
this
is
your
place
.

My
husband
and
I
take
out
from
here
3-4
times
a
month
.

It
was
divine
melts
in
your
mouth
.

We
ate
at
this
Thai
place
following
the
reviews
but
very
unhappy
with
the
foods
.

The
presentation
of
the
food
was
an
added
bonus
,
it
looked
just
as
great
as
it
tasted
!

It
was
wonderful
.

That's
a
huge
compliment
,
especially
in
the
fickled
restaurant
business
,
...
enough
already
!

We
paid
and
left
because
we
didn't
feel
like
arguing
any
more
.

any
further
needs
we
may
have
had
could
not
have
been
met
since
no
one
stopped
by
the
table
.

While
this
diner
had
reasonably
good
food
,
the
restaurant
staff
seemed
completely
indifferent
to
our
presence
,
and
this
attitude
was
reflected
in
the
lack
of
service
.

We
won't
go
to
this
place
again
for
a
good
meal
.

The
decor
however
seems
to
be
the
distraction
so
you
won't
notice
that
you
just
payed
300
bucks
for
some
cold
eggplant
that
took
2
FRICKIN
HOURS
TO
COME
!
!
!

Don't
get
me
started
on
the
margaritas
,
either
.

The
Seafood
Dynamite
is
also
otherworldly
.

BTW
,
I
really
like
Long
Beach
.

I
love
it
.

It
was
absolutely
amazing
.

I
have
been
going
there
since
it
opened
and
I
can't
get
enough
.

They
charge
different
prices
all
the
time
.

In
about
12
minutes
,
the
thing
is
gone
.

Not
only
is
the
cuisine
the
best
around
,
the
service
has
always
been
attentive
and
charming
.

The
food
we
ordered
was
excellent
,
although
I
wouldn't
say
the
margaritas
were
anything
to
write
home
about
.

I
was
almost
amused
by
the
fact
that
she
was
turning
away
customers
at
9pm
on

night

that
night
-
WTF
?
?

We
go
often
for
lunch
and
the
place
is
packed
.

You
never
feel
icky
and
stuffed
after
you
eat
there
.

We
ended
our
great
experience
by
having
Gulab
Jamun
(
dessert
)
recommended
by
the
waiter
.

The
service
was
fast
and
friendly
and
the
food
was
very
tasty
and
they
had
the
best
hot
sauce
to
add
to
your
meals
.

The
service
was
excellent
and
the
food
was
delicious
.

Wine
list
selection
is
good
and
wine-by-the-glass
was
generously
filled
to
the
top
.

–
By
far
the
best
bar
in
the
east
village
...

I
went
there
with
a
friend
from
out
of
town
...
and
we
were
both
very
impressed
!

I
generally
like
this
place
.

By
far
the
best
salad
I
have
had
in
a
fast
food
restaurant
.

Mazing
interior
.

A
little
noise
but
I
think
that
was
because
of
our
party
!

I
picked
the
asparagus
,
which
turned
out
to
be
incredible
and
perfectly
prepared
.

Once
seated
it
took
about
30
minutes
to
finally
get
the
meal
.

I
have
lived
in
Japan
for
7
years
and
the
taste
of
the
food
and
the
feel
of
the
restaurant
is
like
being
back
in
Japan
.

Unique
apppetizers
.

I
found
the
food
,
service
and
value
exceptional
everytime
I
have
been
there
.

We
are
locals
,
and
get
the
feeling
the
only
way
this
place
survives
with
such
average
food
is
because
most
customers
are
probably
one-time
customer
tourists
.

turnip

at
the
little
kiosk
on
east
side
of
Mott
St
.
just
south
of
bayard

It
was
decent
but
nothing
exceptional
.

I
loved
everythig
about
it-especially
the
shows
and
actors
.

It
was
pretty
inexpensive
too
.

Also
,
there
was
only
one
bathroom
stall
-
probably
need
more
for
such
big
crowds
.

Open

Do
not
get
the
Go
Go
Hamburgers
,
no
matter
what
the
reviews
say
.

The
food
is
great
and
reasonably
priced
.

I
think
the
stuff
was
better
than
Disney
.

Since
we
were
already
waiting
so
long
,
we
felt
we
had
no
other
choice
but
to
accept
it
.

The
first
time
the
sushi
was
outstanding
,
the
second
time
it
was
a
little
bland
.

We
have
gone
for
dinner
only
a
few
times
but
the
same
great
quality
and
service
is
given
.

honestly
the
worst
sushi
my
husband
and
i
had
in
our
entire
lives
.

Somehow
working
the
italian
charm
with
constant
mille
grazie
does
not
constitute
proper
service
.

Atmosphere
was
nice
.

hidden
little
jem

THE
SERVICE
IS
AMAZING
,
i've
had
different
waiters
and
they
were
all
nice
,
which
is
a
rare
thing
in
NYC
.

If
you
don't
like
it
,
I
don't
know
what
to
tell
you
.

The
blond
wood
decor
is
very
soothing
,
the
premium

is
excellent
and
the
service
is
great
.

Patsy's
Pizza
=
true
love

All
the
various
Greek
and
Cypriot
dishes
are
excellent
,
but
the
gyro
is
the
reason
to
come--if
you
don't
eat
one
your
trip
was
wasted
.

If
you
can
,
come
to
this
place
by
boat
and
make
it
a
whole
evening
.

As
to
my
comment
about
the
food
,
no
apology
or
acknowledgment
was
made
.

When
we
threatened
to
leave
,
we
were
offered
a
meager
discount
even
though
half
the
order
was
missing
.

Consistently
good
Japanese
Tapas
.

I
highly
recommend
visiting
this
restaurant
and
having
dinner
and
drinks
!

Dinners
have
always
been
excellent
,
in
terms
of
food
quality
.

The
Dancing
,
White
River
and
Millenium
rolls
are
musts
.

–
Love
their
pizza
,
especially
the
mushroom
pizza
.

Perfect
on
a
cold
day
.

Big
Wong

Ups
for
a
fine

.

Unless
you
are
just
stopping
in
for
a
few
drinks
I
wouldn't
recommend
going
here
.

Most
importantly
,
we
were
so
excited
about
the
food
after
seeing
the
very
creative
menu
.

They
never
brought
us
complimentary
noodles
,
ignored
repeated
requests
for
sugar
,
and
threw
our
dishes
on
the
table
.

Yes
,
it
is
good
,
but
I've
had
better
for
cheaper
.

Freshest
sushi
–
I
love
this
restaurant
.

Very
"
normal
Indian
food
"
,
but
done
really
well
.

We
ordered
the
marinated
grapes
,
buffalo
style
chicken
wings
,
and
the
turkey
sandwich
.

The
food
was
amazing
,
and
the
service
was
prompt
and
helpful
,
but
not
over-bearing
or
rushed
.

With
so
many
poor
experiences
to
be
had
in
the
theater
district
,
is
truly
an
excellent
find
!

i
love
their
chicken
pasta
cant
remember
the
name
but
is
sooo
good

But
that
wasn't
the
icing
on
the
cake
:
a
tiramisu
that
resembled
nothing
I
have
ever
had
.

Delivery
can
be
spot
on
or
lacking
depending
on
the
weather
and
the
day
of
the
week
.

The
food
now
is
inconsistent
.

great
beer

Maybe
it
was
the
great
company
(
I
had
friends
visiting
from
Philly
–
yes
,
it
was
not
a
date
this
time
)
or
the
super
reasonable
price
point
,
but
I
just
can
’
t
say
enough
good
things
about
this
brasserie
.

The
lemon
chicken
tasted
like
sticky
sweet
donuts
and
the
honey
walnut
prawns
,
the
few
they
actually
give
you
...
were
not
good
.

Which
lets
face
it
...
at
times
it's
a
good
thing
.

Drinks
way
over
priced
.

Its
located
in
greenewich
village
.

It's
a
great
little
place
with
tons
of
potential
to
be
a
neighborhood
joint
if
the
service
weren't
so
impersonal
and
corporate-like
.

We
never
ate
because
by
close
to
2
in
the
monring
we
were
not
served
and
were
too
upset
ad
tired
to
start
eating
.

I
have
eaten
at
many
pizza
places
around
NYC
and
this
is
hands
down
the
worst
.

To
be
honest
we
only
ever
eat
the
Shabu
Shabu
.

I
would
recommend
Roxy's
for
that
,
but
not
for
their
food
.

Nevertheless
,
I
finished
my
plate
,
and
that's
when
I
found
a
maggot
in
mushroom
sauce
at
the
bottom
.

Drinks
are
suberb
,
and
I
feel
like
I
am
in
a
Third
World
country
when
I
walk
in
the
door
.

Murray
won't
do
it
.

Winnie
and
her
staff
are
the
best
crew
you
can
find
serving
you
.

Decor
is
nice
though
service
can
be
spotty
.

If
you
like
the
food
and
the
value
you
get
from
some
of
Chinatown
restaurants
,
this
is
not
the
place
for
you
.

Although
the
tables
may
be
closely
situated
,
the
candle-light
,
food
-
quality
and
service
overcompensate
.

great
lunch
spot

Going
to
Bark
is
always
worth
the
train
ride
,
and
will
make
your
tongue
and
belly
very
happy
!

We
shared
the
family
platter
and
I
especially
enjoyed
the
black
cod
in
sake
kasu
.

But
the
best
part
about
LS
is
the
late
night
atmosphere
,
delightfully
free
of
the
BTs
.

She
then
put
the
check
down
without
asking
if
we
were
done
,
and
came
to
check
on
the
bill
every
two
minutes
,
even
though
we
were
one
of
three
occupied
tables
.

Their
tuna
tartar
appetizer
is
to
die
for
.

Highly
recommended
!

My
wife
also
ordered
a
teapot
of
hot
water
(
she
had
a
sore
throat
)
and
I
guess
that
since
it
was
only
water
,
it
wasn't
a
priority
for
them
to
actually
bring
it
.

The
dinner
only
took
us
about
an
hour
and
the
prices
were
alright
for
the
strip
,
almost
$
50
/
pp
after
tax
and
tip
(
about
average
)
.

She
doesn't
make
you
feel
welcome
and
treats
you
like
an
annoyance
.

I
would
say
that
all
was
fine
and
tasty
but
the
heaviness
on
my
stomach
someting
that
i
can't
not
mention
or
undermine
.

the
only
problem
is
you
really
have
to
warm
up
the
pizza
before
it's
edible
,
even
when
you
order
ahead
.

I'll
being
with
a
couple
of
positives
:
cool
decor
,
good
pita
and
hummus
,
and
grilled
octopus
that
was
actually
pretty
tasty
.

If
the
weather
is
nice
,
try
to
snag
an
outside
table
.

They
serve
it
in
a
tall
,
skinny
hour-glass
shaped
glass
to
disguise
the
fact
that
you
a
getting
a
small
juice
at
the
price
of
a
half
gallon
in
a
supermarket
.

You'll
pay
at
least
double
at
any
other
Italian
restaurant
in
the
city
,
and
most
still
don't
compare
.

And
the
Tom
Kha
soup
was
pathetic
.

The
Four
Seasons
has
history
and
it
is
a
sort
of
landmark
of
New
York
City
restaurants
,
but
trust
me
,
they
will
charge
you
through
the
nose
just
so
that
you
can
say
"
I've
been
to
the
four
seasons
restaurant
"
.

When
you
add
it
all
together
,
it
just
doesn't
seem
worth
it
to
me
...
especially
considering
the
prices
.

Right
off
the
L
in
Brooklyn
this
is
a
nice
cozy
place
with
good
pizza
.

Steamed
fresh
so
brought
hot
hot
hot
to
your
table
.

The
wine
the
service
was
very
good
too
.

Overall
the
food
quality
was
pretty
good
,
though
I
hear
the
salmon
is
much
better
when
it
hasn't
sat
cooling
in
front
of
the
guest
.

The
restaurant
looks
out
over
beautiful
green
lawns
to
the
Hudson
River
and
the
Statue
of
Liberty
.

if
you're
daring
,
try
the
balsamic
vinegar
over
icecream
,
it's
wonderful
!

the
atmosphere
is
great
.

The
staff
has
been
nice
,
but
they
seemed
really
stressed
and
the
unisex
bathroom
needs
to
be
cleaned
more
often
.

Food
was
amazing
-
I
love
Indian
food
and
eat
it
quite
regularly
,
but
I
can
say
this
is
one
of
the
best
I've
had
.

Best
meal
in
a
long
time
!

Great
pizza
and
fantastic
service
.

Located
at
the
end
of
a
magnificent
block
.

Can
’
t
believe
how
an
expensive
NYC
restaurant
can
be
so
disrespectful
to
its
clients
.

Unbelievable
.

i've
been
to
sapphire
twice
and
both
times
the
food
was
fine
,
if
not
good
.

i
happen
to
have
a
policy
that
goes
along
with
a
little
bit
of
self-respect
,
which
includes
not
letting
a
waiter
intimidate
me
,
i
.
e
.
make
me
feel
bad
asking
for
trivialities
like
water
,
or
the
check
.

great
meal
–
the
fish
on
the
omikase
platter
was
absolutely
decadent
-
-
there
was
none
of
the
stringiness
that
sometimes
accompanies
fair
sushi
-
-
this
fish
was
perfect
!
!
!

The
ambience
was
nice
,
but
service
wasn't
so
great
.

–
Eggs
,
pancakes
,
potatoes
,
fresh
fruit
and
yogurt
-
-
everything
they
serve
is
delicious
.

His
response
was
smug
,
arrogant
,
and
condescending
,
totally
consistent
with
his
deportment
on
display
all
evening
.

Went
on
a
Monday
night
,
so
there
was
no
wait
for
a
table
.

Too
many
other
good
places
to
have
to
settle
.

I'd
definitely
go
back
again
.

you
are
with
a
hot
date
and
he
/
she
has
an
urge
for
sushi
...
then
this
might
be
the
place
.

However
,
this
place
is
a
gem
,
and
I
won't
stop
going
back
.

this
place
had
ALL
the
trimmings
and
i
mean
all
.

I
picked
the
Grilled
Black
Cod
as
my
entree
,
which
I
absolutely
devoured
while
someone
commented
that
the
Grilled
Salmon
dish
was
better
.

Everyone
must
come
here
at
least
once
.

If
you
want
to
dine
with
large
party
,
I
recommend
to
make
reservation

Our
server

go
here

Gorgeous
place
ideal
for
a
romantic
dinner

Delicate
spices
,

eggs
and
a

Don't
judge
this
place
prima
facie
,
you
have
to
try
it
to
believe
it
,
a
home
away
from
home
for
the
literate
heart

Definitely
a
great
spot
for
a
nice
occasion
or

Pacifico
is

is

The
owner

are
all
Japanese
as
well
and
that
adds
to
the
entire
ambiance

Lives
up
to
the
hype

The
music
playing
was
very
hip
,
20-30
something
pop
music
,
but
the
subwoofer
to
the
sound
system
was
located
under
my
seat
,
which
became
annoying
midway
through
dinner
.

I
believe
there
were
2
shrimp
in
the
"
salt
encrusted
shrimp
"
appetizer
.

Not
sure
where
the
previous
reviewer
,
lonk
,
dined
,
but
Saul
is
in
a
great
neighborhood
and
has
great
food
!

We
will
be
back
.

Much
more
reasonably
priced
too
!

Still
,
any
quibbles
about
the
bill
were
off-set
by
the
pour-your-own
measures
of
liquers
which
were
courtesey
of
the
house
...

Place
is
open
till
late
,
no
dress
code
.

And
the
service
was
simply
spendid
-
quite
a
delight
.

The
spicy
Tuna
roll
is
huge
and
probably
the
best
that
I've
had
at
this
price
range
.

I'm
telling
you
...

Another
review
here
claimed
the
pre-fix
was
$
29
/
per
person
including
sake
but
it
is
$
55
per
person
not
including
sake
.

Staff
is
very
accomodating
.

Service
was
very
prompt
but
slightly
rushed
.

Many
people
talk
about
the
great
pizza
and
poor
service
,
so
it
can't
just
be
the
rantings
of
a
few
dissatisfied
customers
.

the
fish
was
fresh
,
though
it
was
cut
very
thin
.

never
swaying
,
never
a
bad
meal
,
never
bad
service
...

I
have
to
say
that
I
am
pleasantly
suprised
and
I
will
most
likely
stop
in
again
if
I
am
in
the
neighborhood
.

best
chinese
food
i
have
tasted
in
a
long
time

well
,
i
didn't
find
it
there
,
and
trust
,
i
have
told
everyone
i
can
think
of
about
my
experience
.

i
highly
recommend
this
place
to
all
that
want
to
try
indain
food
for
the
first
time
.

The
waitress
was
not
attentive
at
all
.

Be
sure
to
try
the
oyster
roll
.

Looking
around
,
I
saw
a
room
full
of
New
Yorkers
enjoying
a
real
meal
in
a
real
restaurant
,
not
a
clubhouse
of
the
fabulous
trying
to
be
seen
.

If
only
they
delivered
,
they'd
make
a
mint
!

it
is
not
consistent
.

Excellent
food
,
although
the
interior
could
use
some
help
.

I
recently
tried
Suan
and
I
thought
that
it
was
great
.

The
food
is
simply
unforgettable
!

I
ordered
the
vitello
alla
marsala
and
I
was
pretty
impressed
.

I
complained
to
the
manager
,
but
he
was
not
even
apologetic
.

We
had
Lava
Cake
...
we
ordered
when
our
food
came
it
takes
at
least
a
1/2
to
make
it
.

The
food
was
good
too
.

it's
delicious
!

The
service
ranges
from
mediocre
to
offensive
.

The
only
downside
...
they
only
take
cash
which
is
OK
if
you
know
about
it
ahead
of
time
.

My
quesadilla
tasted
like
it
had
been
made
by
a
three-year
old
with
no
sense
of
proportion
or
flavor
.

(
The
asparagus
,
truffle
oil
,
parmesan
bruschetta
is
a
winner
!
)

We're
going
back
.
:D

The
food
looked
very
appetizing
and
delicious
since
it
came
on
a
variety
of
fancy
plates
.

We
have
tried
every
Thai
restaurant
between
Atlantic
Avenue
and
4th
Streets
,
and
Joya
is
the
best
.

Seabass
on
lobster
risotto
was
the
best
.

I
came
across
Village
Underground
by
accident
,
now
I
go
there
all
the
time
.

The
atmosphere
isn't
the
greatest
,
but
I
suppose
that's
how
they
keep
the
prices
down
.

Too
bad
I
had
paid
an
extra
$
2
for
the
stone
bowl
.

Overall
,
I
would
go
back
and
eat
at
the
restaurant
again
.

This
restaurant
is
VEGETARIAN
;
there
are
NO
MEAT
dishes
whatsoever
.

Starters
:
Kobe
Beef
Sashimi
.

We've
lived
in
the
area
for
more
than
8
years
.

The
staff
is
very
good
.

You
must
have
the
crabmeat
lasagna
which
is
out
of
this
world
and
the
chocolate
bread
pudding
for
dessert
.

Try
the
lobster
teriyaki
and
the
rose
special
roll
.

After
that
she
simply
took
our
plates
,
walked
away
,
came
back
another
TWENTY
minutes
later
with
the
bill
and
the
chicken
on
it
!
!
!

Wine
list
is
extensive
without
being
over-priced
.

My
daughter's
wedding
reception
at
Water's
Edge
received
the
highest
compliments
from
our
guests
.

keep
up
the
good
work
.

Volare
virgins
or
weekly
regulars
,
everyone
gets
treated
the
same
and
you
can't
ask
for
more
than
that
when
the
service
is
this
friendly
.

Whose
writing
all
the
great
reviews
?

I
absolutely
love
this
place
!
!
!

Conveniently
located
too
,
being
right
on
Bedford
ave
.

Very
Disappointing

Chow
fun
was
dry
;
pork
shu
mai
was
more
than
usually
greasy
and
had
to
share
a
table
with
loud
and
rude
family
.

It
hits
the
spot
every
time

The
sushi
is
amazing
!
!
!

I
CAN
EAT
HERE
EVERY
DAY
OF
THE
WEEK
REALLY
LOL
LOVE
THIS
PLACE
...
)

I
don't
appreciate
places
or
people
that
try
to
drive
up
the
bill
without
the
patron's
knowledge
so
that
was
a
huge
turnoff
(
more
than
the
price
)
.

The
food
was
average
or
above
including
some
surprising
tasty
dishes
.

The
sushi
was
awful
!

I'm
astonished
that
this
restaurant
is
categorized
as
$
$
$
rather
than
$
$
$
.

my
service
was
stellar
!

I'd
go
back
there
in
a
heartbeat
.

However
it
is
the
ONLY
Taiwanese
restaurant
in
town
.

The
decor
is
rustic
,
traditional
Japanese
.

great
taste

Waited
35
minutes
for
a
table
for
8
which
was
ok
for
such
a
big
crowd
.

I
don't
get
it
either
.

The
food
arrived
20
minutes
after
I
called
,
cold
and
soggy
.

Such
a
disappointment
...

I
look
forward
to
eating
here
again

What
really
makes
it
shine
is
the
food
,
which
is
aggressively
seasoned
with
Cyrpriot
spices
,
and
all
made
in-house
(
even
the
gyro
meat
and
sausages
)
,
and
made
of
much
higher
quality
ingredients
that
might
otherwise
be
expected
.

I
made
my
1st
trip
to
the
restaurant
after
finding
their
webpage
online
.

The
servers
at
Flatbush
Farm
appear
to
have
perfected
that
ghastly
technique
of
making
you
feel
guilty
and
ashamed
for
deigning
to
attract
their
attention
.

Hurley's
is
like
Cheers
where
everyone
knows
your
name
and
they
are
ACTUALLY
glad
you
came
.

For
starters
they
delivered
us
someone
else's
order
.

I
am
so
coming
back
here
again
,
as
much
as
I
can
.

Please
be
aware
that
it's
CASH
or
AMEX
only
!

I
though
it
was
expensive
and
I
prefer
Bella
Via
just
blocks
away
by
far
.

I
heard
the
lobster
roll
was
excellent
.

Oh
,
and
there's
hookah
.

Had
no
flavor
and
the
staff
is
rude
and
not
attentive
.

The
wine
list
is
interesting
and
has
many
good
values
.

Overpriced
and
not
tasty

food
was
luke
warm
.

My
husband
and
I
both
ordered
the
Steak
,
medium
.

What
may
be
interesting
to
most
is
the
worst
sevice
/
attitude
comes
from
the
owners
of
this
establishment
.

I'm
saving
up
for
my
next
visit
.

I
have
never
left
a
restaurant
feeling
as
if
i
was
abused
,
and
wasted
my
hard
earned
money
.

the
2
listed
and
then
one
in
Southglenn
mall
parking
lot
which
is
reviewed
here
and
one
in
Ft
Collins
.

Took
my
mom
for
Mother's
Day
,
and
the
maitre
d
'
was
pretty
rude
.

Come
on
.

And
amazingly
cheap
.

For
instance
,
plates
were
just
dumped
on
the
table
,
I
was
handed
the
wine
list
upside
down
,
etc
...

I
got
an
excellent
piece
of
cheesecake
and
we
had
several
other
nice
pastries
.

(
Besides
that
there
should
be
more
restaurants
like
it
around
the
city
)
.

We
order
a
bit
of
everything
on
the
menu
.

We
thought
the
dessert
would
be
better
,
Wrong
!

(
2
)
egg
custards
and
pork
buns
at
either
bakery
on
west
side
of
Mott
street
just
south
of
Canal
.

Ess-A-Bagel
(
either
by
Sty-town
or
midtown
)
is
by
far
the
best
bagel
in
NY
.

Perfection
.

instead
ordered
an
ice
cold
beer
which
to
me
works
with
indian
.

My
husband
and
I
have
been
sold
on
this
from
the
first
visit
.

The
staff
was
accomodating
,
the
food
was
absolutely
delicious
and
the
place
is
lovely
.

It's
just
average
,
just
shredded
,
no
seasoning
on
it
.

Amazing
food
.

I
completely
recommend
Casa
La
Femme
for
any
special
occasion
and
to
REALLY
impress
your
date
.

Their
crab
eggs
benedict
is
addicting
.

Not
one
of
our
meals
was
edible
-
bland
and
/
or
made
with
weird
rosemary
or
orange
flavoring
.

The
entire
staff
was
extremely
accomodating
and
tended
to
my
every
need
.

In
any
event
,
this
is
a
place
I'll
be
sure
to
stop
by
again
when
I'm
in
this
part
of
town
.

If
you're
into
being
lost
when
you're
just
five
feet
from
your
table
then
hey
,
that's
a
good
thing
.

We
liked
it
so
much
,
that
we
will
always
make
it
a
point
to
dine
here
when
we
visit
New
York
.

If
you
go
,
try
the
marinara
/
arrabiatta
sauce
,
the
mozzarella
en
Carozza
is
mmmmmmmm
...
everything
is
just
delicious
.

its
just
a
fun
place
to
go
,
not
a
five
star
restaraunt
.

The
pesto
pizza
was
excellent
,
thin-crust
pizza
with
a
nice
amount
of
spicy
Italian
cheese
that
I'd
never
heard
of
before
.

During
our
trip
to
NYC
,
we
made
reservations
to
dine
in
the
pool
room
of
the
Four
Seasons
for
their
pre-theater
menu
(
offering
a
modified
menu
for
$
65
pp
)
.

Easily
the
worst
stir-fried
squid
I've
ever
tasted
.

Same
owner
as
the
guy
who
owns
Typhoon
,
which
is
just
down
the
street
on
St
.
Marks
and
1st
Ave
.

–
Ray's
(
suprisingly
)
has
the
city's
BEST
&
most
diverse
wine
list
.

Probably
would
not
go
back
here
.

We
will
go
back
every
time
we
are
in
the
City
.

Sit
in
the
Balcony

we
have
been
there
3
times
since
last
week
we
alked
it
by
chance
first
day
the
manager
offerd
us
the
margherita
pizza
adn
we
said
yes
.

A
word
to
the
wise
:
you
can't
dine
here
and
disturb
the
maitre-D
'
s
sense
of
"
table
turnover
"
,
as
whacked
as
it
is
,
or
else
.

Bring
your
cell
phone
cause
you
may
have
to
wait
to
get
into
the
best
sushi
restaurant
in
the
world
:
BLUE
RIBBON
SUSHI
.

We
left
,
never
to
return
.

I
was
speechless
by
the
horrible
food
.

Not
sure
if
I
would
go
back
.

Salads
are
a
delicious
way
to
begin
the
meal
.

The
only
problem
is
that
the
manager
is
a
complete
incompetent
.

This
place
is
charming
and
relaxing
.

My
friends
spoke
so
much
about
it
for
months
,
I
finally
made
the
time
to
come
down
ear
and
dine
in
.

Well
worth
it

Prices
too
high
for
this
cramped
and
unappealing
resturant
.

The
food
here
does
a
great
service
to
the
name
(
Cantonese
that
is
...
)
.

This
place
rocks
!
!

Yakitori
(
bbq
meats
)
is
tasty
too
.

Parking
is
reasonably
good
,
they
have
their
own
lot
and
you
can
park
in
the
park
nearby
.

I
had
fish
and
my
husband
had
the
filet
-
both
of
which
exceeded
our
expectations
.

Appetizers
took
nearly
an
hour
.

Can
get
busy
on
Fridays
for
a
table
but
once
seated
,
the
service
is
so
efficient
you
can
be
in
and
out
of
there
quickly
.

To
sum
it
up
:
Service
varies
from
good
to
mediorce
,
depending
on
which
waiter
you
get
;
generally
it
is
just
average
Ok
.

It
is
simply
amazing
.

So
close
,
but
not
good
enough
.

My
son
and
his
girlfriend
both
wanted
cheeseburgers
and
they
were
huge
!

I
had
the
Thai
style
Fried
Sea
Bass
...
which
was
very
good
.

–
My
first
time
to
dine
at
this
restaurant
was
with
my
son
and
it
was
absolutely
horrible
!

I
am
happy
i
did
the
food
was
awsome
.

Their
pad
penang
is
delicious
and
everything
else
is
fantastic
.

I
highly
recommend
to
anyone
to
give
this
place
a
try
.

Logic
behind
that
?

Best
.
Sushi
.
Ever
.

It
doesn't
look
appetizing
as
it's
covered
in
squid
ink
and
it
turns
your
lips
and
teeth
black
,
but
the
taste
was
phenomenal
.

The
farro
salad
and
the
mashed
yukon
potatoes
were
also
extremely
tasty
.

Go
to
son
cubano
in
edgewater
nj
instead
.

Really
,
I
find
it
rather
scandalous
that
such
a
crappy
restaurant
attracts
such
crowds--this
,
in
the
city
of
a
million
restaurants
,
at
least
9/10
of
which
are
way
better
than
this
one
.

–
How
to
describe
the
best
sushi
in
NYC
:
hmmmm
,
delicious
,
amazing
,
fantastic
,
suculent
,
perfect
,
nah
,
all
of
the
above
.

Considering
we
were
the
last
patrons
there
and
it
was
after
the
closing
time
,
the
waitstaff
did
not
rush
us
at
all
and
made
us
feel
comfortable
and
relaxed
.

–
This
was
great
dining
experience
.

This
is
the
case
at
this
gem
.

The
Prix
Fixe
menu
is
worth
every
penny
and
you
get
more
than
enough
(
both
in
quantity
AND
quality
)
.

Just
remember
to
dress
a
little
urban-chic
so
you
don
?
t
look
too
far
out
of
place
.

The
service
is
good
and
the
resturant
is
clean
.

The
only
thing
I
moderately
enjoyed
was
their
Grilled
Chicken
special
with
Edamame
Puree
.

Highly
recommend
it
!

A
friend
from
Seattle
and
I
went
on
a
Thursday
night
around
8:
30
.

From
the
spectacular
caviar
to
the
hospitable
waitstaff
,
I
felt
like
royalty
and
enjoyed
every
second
of
it
.

I
had
my
eyes
on
this
place
,
promising
myself
I
will
one
day
'
give
it
a
try
.
'

The
signs
,
the
specials
menus
,
food
,
and
even
all
the
waitstaff
are
ALL
TOTALLY
Japanese
.

And
really
large
portions
.

We
replied
that
we
would
like
to
wait
5
more
minutes
if
that
was
okay
.

I
was
there
on
sat
.
for
my
birthday
and
we
had
an
excellent
time
.

The
pizza
was
pretty
good
and
huge
.

best
honey
walnyt
prawns
that
we
have
every
tasted
.

The
bar
drinks
were
Eh
,
ok
to
say
the
least
.

I
would
highly
recommend
.

Despite
the
confusing
mirrors
this
will
likely
be
my
go-to
for
modern
Japanese
food
for
the
foreseeable
future
.

I've
never
had
bad
service
and
the
fish
is
fresh
and
delicious
.

Would
NEVER
go
back

Best
Indian
Restaurant
in
the
City

I
will
be
back
!

I
think
the
pizza
is
so
overrated
and
was
under
cooked
.

My
friend
from
Milan
and
myself
were
pleasantly
surprised
when
we
arrived
and
everyone
spoke
italian
.

Even
though
its
good
seafood
,
the
prices
are
too
high
.

however
,
it's
the
service
that
leaves
a
bad
taste
in
my
mouth
.

First
off
,
the
food
came
fast
and
all
together
:)
i
like
that
...
i
hate
the
pretentiousness
of
things
coming
in
one
after
the
other
.

Great
food
with
an
awesome
atmosphere
!

WHAT
ELSE
CAN
YOU
SAY
NICE
PEOPLE
AMAZING
FOOD
WOW

The
restaurant
is
cute
but
not
upscale
.

The
service
was
poor
,
restaurant
poorly
lit
,
staff
not
very
attentive
and
I
would
have
rather
eaten
at
a
Mcdonald's
than
this
joint
.

NOT
THE
PLACE
IT
ONCE
WAS

It
was
romantic
-
and
even
nice
even
with
my
sister
,
reminded
me
of
Italy
,
and
had
artwork
and
music
that
kept
up
the
feeling
of
being
in
a
Mediterrean
villa
.

The
price
very
reasonable
.

Best
Neighborhood
Standby
.

Our
waitress
wasn't
mean
,
but
not
especially
warm
or
attentive
either
.

Enjoyed
a
very
nice
Caesar
Salad
while
my
wife
had
arugula
and
goat
cheese
...
both
very
tasty
.

Drawbacks
:
service
is
slow
and
they
don't
toast
!

After
really
enjoying
ourselves
at
the
bar
we
sat
down
at
a
table
and
had
dinner
.

One
special
roll
and
one
regular
roll
is
enough
to
fill
you
up
,
but
save
room
for
dessert
!

the
waitstaffs
are
nice
though
.

We
left
without
ever
getting
service
.

I
have
eaten
a
lot
of
pizza
here
.

Thank
you
everyone
at
Water's
Edge
.

In
the
summer
months
,
the
back
garden
area
is
really
nice
.

This
is
some
really
good
,
inexpensive
sushi
.

There
are
so
many
other
great
places
to
go
to
eat
and
drink
...
this
place
is
not
worth
it
...

The
sashimi
is
always
fresh
and
the
rolls
are
innovative
and
delicious
.

The
prior
reviews
said
Kid
friendly
...
give
me
a
break
with
two
young
children
that
is
light
years
.

The
chicken
lollipop
is
my
favorite
,
most
of
the
dishes
(
I
have
to
agree
with
a
previous
reviewer
)
are
quite
oily
and
very
spicy
,
espeically
the
Chilli
Chicken
.

I
have
been
coming
here
for
years
and
have
nothing
but
good
things
to
say
about
the
service
and
the
great
staff
at
La
Lanterna
.

Ive
asked
a
cart
attendant
for
a
lotus
leaf
wrapped
rice
and
she
replied
back
rice
and
just
walked
away
.

Try
the
Pad
Thai
,
it's
fabulous
and
their
prices
are
so
cheap
!

Our
food
was
great
too
!

NO
PIZZA
33
for
me
!

Sometimes
tables
don't
understand
his
sense
of
humor
but
it's
refreshing
to
have
a
server
who
has
personality
,
professionalism
,
and
respects
the
privacy
of
your
dinner
.

I
honestly
don't
even
know
where
to
begin
.

Everyone
raved
about
the
atmosphere
(
elegant
rooms
and
absolutely
incomparable
views
)
and
the
fabulous
food
!

A
beautifully
designed
dreamy
Egyptian
restaurant
that
gets
sceney
at
night
.

I've
never
ordered
anything
else
from
their
menu
...
there's
no
need
to
.

I've
lived
in
NY
for
5
years
and
this
place
has
it
all
.

The
restaurant
has
a
Family
feel
,
not
least
with
regard
to
the
portions
which
are
enormous
;
the
veal
alone
could
have
single-handedly
solved
third
world
famine
.

Always
good
drinks
and
service
is
pretty
good
;

They're
are
better
Taiwanese
restaurants
and
they
are
located
in
Flushing
,
Queens
.

Here
the
hot
dog
is
elevated
to
the
level
of
a
real
entree
with
numerous
variations
available
.

It
was
worth
the
wait
.

We
’
re
can
’
t
say
enough
about
their
delicious
gourmet
pizza
’
s
!

It's
popular
w
/
the
late
crowd
.

We
were
quickly
seated
and
requested
the
special
dinner
,
which
came
with
:
1
)
Shellfish
and
Shrimp
appetizer
or
Caesar
Salad
,
2
)
9
oz
steak
(
with
a
single
potato
chip
)
,
and
3
)
homemade
donut
holes
.

for
7
years
they
have
put
out
the
most
tasty
,
most
delicious
food
and
kept
it
that
way
...

This
is
one
of
the
best
comfort
food
places
in
the
city
.

I
paid
just
about
$
60
for
a
good
meal
,
though
:)

We
even
had
a
visit
from
the
Manager
who
wanted
to
make
sure
we
were
enjoying
ourselves
.

Go
to
Volare
for
1st
class
service
and
terrific
food
.

The
dining
room
is
quietly
elegant
with
no
music
to
shout
over
-
-
how
refreshing
!

The
atmosphere
is
aspiring
,
and
the
decor
is
festive
and
amazing
..

I
can
highly
recommend
their
various
saag
and
paneer
and
korma
.

The
staff
is
incredibly
helpful
and
attentive
.

The
food
was
pretty
tradional
but
it
was
hot
and
good
with
large
portions
.

Traditional
French
decour
was
pleasant
though
the
hall
was
rather
noisy
-
the
restaurant
was
full
and
we
had
to
raise
our
voices
to
be
able
to
maintain
a
conversation
.

The
fish
was
really
,
really
fresh
.

The
price
is
reasonable
although
the
service
is
poor
.

Decor
is
charming
.

Just
not
good
at
all
.

I
go
and
eat
out
at
many
different
restaurants
and
this
is
one
place
you
have
go
and
try
.

Don't
be
fooled
by
crowds
of
people
.

IT
WAS
HORRIBLE
.

We
,
there
were
four
of
us
,
arrived
at
noon
-
the
place
was
empty
-
and
the
staff
acted
like
we
were
imposing
on
them
and
they
were
very
rude
.

Very
,
very
nice

The
waitress
moved
our
table
practically
into
the
bathroom
and
when
we
asked
to
cancel
our
dinner
orders
because
we
did
not
want
to
eat
sitting
on
the
toilet
,
we
were
told
no
...

not
only
is
the
food

I'm
a
friendly
person
,
so
I
wouldn't
mind
had
she
not
been
so
nasty
and
gotten
so
personal
.

This
is
sad
for
what
once
was
one
of
the
best
places
you
could
ever
eat
.

We
will
definitely
go
back
.

but
the
service
was
a
bit
slow
.

The
manager
came
to
the
table
and
said
we
can
do
what
we
want
,
so
we
paid
for
what
we
did
enjoy
,
the
drinks
and
appetizers
,
and
walked
out
.

They
pay
such
detail
to
everything
from
miso
soup
to
complex
rolls
.

Late
night
dinning
with
exeptional
food
.

What
we
did
do
was
waste
3
hours
being
trapped
in
a
table
waiting
and
waiting
for
food
and
drinks
and
hooka
..
some
of
which
we
never
received
!

Patroon
features
a
nice
cigar
bar
and
has
great
staff
.

I
came
here
for
my
friend's
birthday
and
keep
coming
back
ever
since
.

Ive
been
to
many
Thai
restaurants
in
Manhattan
before
,
and
Toons
is
by
far
the
best
Thai
food
Ive
had
(
except
for
my
mom's
of
course
)
.

Consequently
,
their
burgers
fell
apart
in
their
hands
and
made
such
a
mess
that
they
did'nt
feel
like
finishing
them
.

However
,
go
for
the
ambience
,
and
consider
the
food
just
a
companion
for
a
trip
across
the
world
!

It
is
nearly
impossible
to
get
a
table
,
so
if
you
ever
have
the
chance
to
go
here
for
dinner
,
DO
NOT
pass
it
up
.

Growing
up
in
NY
,
I
have
eaten
my
share
of
bagels
.

Noodle
pudding
is
exactly
the
type
of
service
and
food
I
enjoy
.

This
small
Astoria
souvlaki
spot
makes
what
many
consider
the
best
gyros
in
New
York
.

Only
drawback
-
they
won't
toast
your
bagel
,
and
they
don't
make
eggs
for
the
bagel
.

Also
,
because
it
is
so
thin
,
it
gets
cold
very
quickly
and
its
not
that
filling
.

Price
no
more
than
a
Jersey
deli
but
way
better
.

Nice
food
but
no
spice
!

I
would
highly
recommend
it
.

La
Rosa
waltzes
in
,
and
I
think
they
are
doing
it
the
best
.

Entrees
:
Vanison
steak
and
Bison
Steak
.

While
I
could
have
done
without
the
youth
who
shared
the
evening
with
us
,
our
wonderful
server
and
food
made
the
experience
a
very
positive
one
.

10
!

I
should
have
thought
to
bring
it
up
but
never
expected
the
food
to
be
that
mild
.

I
have
been
to
this
place
,
folks
and
it
is
BAD
.

You
fellas
above
says
its
the
best
Taiwanese
restaurant
in
town
.

Our
friends
have
not
arrived
yet
.

Its
great
if
you
spent
the
day
there
and
didn't
want
to
drive
to
eat
.

It
’
s
just
you
and
your
date
and
an
occasional
cute
‘
excuse
me
’
before
the
waiter
opens
the
little
curtain
to
your
booth
!

The
nakgi-bokum
was
horrible
.

Service
was
wonderful
;

Green
Tea
creme
brulee
is
a
must
!

In
fact
there
is
only
one
I've
tried
that
even
compares
(
shabu
Tatsu
)
and
even
then
I
prefer
Dokebi
.

It's
a
great
place
to
people
watch
.

Bison
was
quite
excellent
however
.

The
takeout
is
great
too
since
they
give
high
quality
tupperware
as
well
.

Fancy
pieces
of
exotic
fish
on
a
$
100
dollar
plate
and
NOT
ONE
was
eatable
.

Prefer
to
order
it
and
pick
it
up
though
because
I
don't
like
the
servers
,
one
young
woman
in
particular
.

I'd
be
horrified
if
my
staff
were
turning
away
customers
so
early
and
so
rudely
!

Best
Indian
food
in
L
.
A
.

You
must
try
the
shrimp
appetizers
.

We
waited
for
an
hour
to
be
seated
.

I
would
not
expect
this
for
a
$
55
dinner
.

They
have
it
all
-
-
great
price
,
food
,
and
service
.

I
recommend
getting
a
reservation
even
though
we
saw
people
seated
without
one
.

Dungeness
crabs
here
!

I
have
been
going
back
again
and
again
.

Food
is
great
.

My
boyfriend
had
Prime
Rib
it
was
good
.

The
lobster
knuckles
(
special
of
the
day
)
were
ok
,
but
pretty
tasteless
.

The
restaurant
offers
an
extensive
wine
list
and
an
ambiance
you
won't
forget
!

Not
because
you
are
"
The
Four
Seasons
"
...
–
you
are
allowed
to
charge
an
arm
and
a
leg
for
a
romatic
dinner
.

Old
school
meets
New
world
.

We
didn't
look
like
the
other
patrons
in
there
so
unfortunately
I
think
that
may
have
been
part
of
the
problem
.

Service
not
the
friendliest
to
our
"
large
party
"
!

When
you're
sitting
in
their
main
dining
room
(
which
has
a
spectacular
,
hand-painted
high
ceiling
)
you'd
never
know
there
was
a
world
outside
.

Great
Breakfast

This
tiny
Williamsburg
spot
is
always
pleasantly
surprising
.

Why
is
it
that
(
almost
)
every
good
review
is
by
"
anonymous
?
"

My
wife
and
I
ate
here
earlier
this
week
and
have
not
stopped
ranting
and
raving
about
the
food
.

Food
was
very
good
as
well
,
considering
that
we
tried
the
budget
selection
(
though
I
wish
the
pork
belly
that
I
ordered
was
roasted
a
bit
longer
,
so
that
fat
was
more
of
a
melt-in-your-mouth
experience
)
.

Pizza
was
a
little
soggy
.

Snotty
Attitude

WAY
OVER-RATED
!
!
!

We
ate
out
in
the
back
patio
,
which
is
worth
it
as
it's
cool
and
the
music
is
hear
well
there
.

I've
been
to
this
restaurant
over
a
dozen
times
with
no
complaints
to
date
.

The
manager
finally
said
he
would
comp
the
two
glasses
of
wine
(
which
cost
less
than
the
food
)
,
and
made
it
seem
like
a
big
concession
.

This
tiny
restaurant
is
as
cozy
as
it
gets
,
with
that
certain
Parisian
flair
.

Thius
is
a
must
for
anyone
who
loves
Shabu-Shabu
.

The
wine
list
was
extensive
-
though
the
staff
did
not
seem
knowledgeable
about
wine
pairings
.

The
pizza
was
great
.

I
highly
recommend
Cafe
St
.
Bart's
for
their
food
,
the
ambience
and
wonderful
service
.

The
menu
has
so
many
fish
items
and
oysters
.

If
you
go
here
,
do
it
on
his
off-night
.

Leon
is
an
East
Village
gem
:
casual
but
hip
,
with
well
prepared
basic
French
bistro
fare
,
good
specials
,
a
warm
and
lively
atmosphere
.

–
I
loved
the
pumpkin
ravioli
and
the
goat
cheese
gnocchi
(
5
big
ones
to
a
plate
instead
of
20
or
so
little
gnocchis
)
and
my
sister
loved
her
filet
mignon
on
top
of
spinach
and
mashed
potatoes
.

Love
Pizza
33
..

Make
sure
you
try
this
place
as
often
as
you
can
.

I
mentioned
the
squid
dish
wasn't
very
good
when
the
waitress
visited
.

The
staff
there
is
very
attentive
and
down
to
earth
.

While
the
ambiance
and
atmosphere
were
great
,
the
food
and
service
could
have
been
a
lot
better
.

Absolutely
delicious
.

There's
another
girl
who
I
can't
describe
,
she
is
about
5
'
6
"
with
brown
hair
,
who
eavesdrops
on
your
conversation
and
chimes
in
-
except
she
only
hears
the
last
part
of
what
you
said
,
so
her
uninvited
opinions
are
often
out
of
context
and
nothing
to
do
with
what
you're
*
really
*
talking
about
.

Service
is
top
notch
.

Untill
this
happens
,
my
advice
is
to
STAY
AWAY
.

believe
us
,
we've
been
eating
sushi
for
over
15
yrs
.

The
only
drawback
is
the
crowded
seating
and
the
slow
service
.

Immediately
after
we
paid
,
the
waiter
took
the
money
and
said
,
okay
,
you
guys
are
outta
here
.

Also
very
inexpensive
.

Everything
is
always
cooked
to
perfection
,
the
service
is
excellent
,
the
decor
cool
and
understated
.

The
food
was
ok
,
but
the
service
was
so
poor
that
the
food
was
cold
buy
the
time
everyone
in
my
party
was
served
.

The
atmosphere
is
unheralded
,
the
service
impecible
,
and
the
food
magnificant
.

Be
aware
.

The
waiters
are
very
experienced
and
helpful
with
pairing
your
drink
choice
to
your
food
tastes
or
vice
versa
.

This
place
...
god
where
do
i
begin
.

The
food
was
all
good
but
it
was
way
too
mild
.

We
had
half
/
half
pizza
,
mine
was
eggplant
and
my
friend
had
the
buffalo
and
it
was
sooo
huge
for
a
small
size
pizza
!

I
wanted
to
go
there
to
see
if
it
was
worth
it
and
sadly
,
curiousity
got
the
best
of
me
and
I
paid
dearly
for
it
.

The
best
place
for
a
leisure
Sunday
breakfast
amidst
yachts
,
then
take
a
stroll
through
the
nearby
Farmer's
Market
.

Coming
from
Boston
this
place
is
like
Emma's
Pizza
in
Kendall
Square
in
Cambridge
(
although
they
have
more
funky
toppings
!
)

My
girlfriend
,
being
slightly
more
aggressive
,
and
having
been
equally
disgusted
causing
her
to
throw
out
the
remainder
of
her
barely
eaten
meal
,
called
back
only
to
be
informed
that
I
was
probably
wrong
and
that
it
was
most
likely
an
oyster
,
and
that
we
were
also
blacklisted
from
their
restaurant
.

The
bibimbap
was
average
,
but
the
stone
bowl
wasn't
even
close
to
sizzling
.

For
all
you
lazy
folks
that
don't
want
to
come
to
Alphabet
City
,
I
say
,
good
-
stay
out
.

The
best
calamari
in
Seattle
!

Drinks
:
2
glasses
of
Dom
Perignon
at
$
35
each
.

Problem
is
nothing
at
Prune
is
particularly
memorable
.

quacamole
at
pacifico
is
yummy
,
as
are
the
wings
with
chimmichuri
.

I
must
give
it
Yon
out
of
Yon
stars
!

To
top
it
all
off
..
the
main
reason
we
came
to
your
restaurant
was
for
the
belly
dancers
and
missed
the
first
show
as
we
were
not
seated
yet
and
the
2nd
belly
dancer
only
danced
at
two
tables
in
the
back
of
the
restaurant
and
never
made
it
around
to
the
other
half
of
the
restaurant
.

The
veal
and
the
mushrooms
were
cooked
perfectly
.

Decent
wine
at
reasonable
prices
.

I
will
definetly
be
going
back
.

I
was
wrong
.

I
got
the
$
10
10
-
piece
dim
sum
combo
,
every
bite
of
which
was
great
.

Have
gone
to
all
the
top
places
.

I
took
one
bite
from
the
$
24
salmon
,
and
I
have
never
,
in
the
17
years
I
have
been
going
to
restaurants
tasted
salmon
as
fishy
,
as
dry
,
and
as
bland
as
the
one
in
Flatbush
Farms
.

After
we
ate
our
appetizers
(
which
took
all
of
8
minutes
)
we
ordered
another
round
of
Brahma's
-
and
tried
to
stall
a
little
as
we
waited
for
our
sixth
dinner
member
.

the
brocollis
were
so
fresh
and
tasty
.

Indoor
ambience
was
modern
.

We
didn't
want
a
bottle
of
bubbly
on
a
weekday
so
we
each
got
little
bottles
of
Korbett
it
was
just
enough
.

–
I
was
highly
disappointed
in
the
food
at
Pagoda
.

There
is
no
way
it
justifies
the
accolades
it
receives
,
the
attitude
of
the
staff
or
the
wait
for
a
table
.

On
a
recent
Sunday
afternoon
,
a
friend
and
I
accidently
found
this
great
restaurant
on
our
way
to
see
the
pulitzer
prize
winning
play
DOUBT
.

It's
unpretentious
and
underground
.

Finally
a
reliable
Chinese
restaurant
!

Always
a
nice
crowd
,
but
never
loud
.

A
coworker
and
I
tried
Pacifico
after
work
a
few
Fridays
and
loved
it
.

I
would
go
back
for
the
wine
experience
alone
.

And
they
give
good
quantity
for
the
price
.

It
was
totally
overpriced
-
fish
and
chips
was
about
$
15
...

too
large
for
just
two
people
but
nothing
was
left
.

The
spicy
tuna
roll
was
unusually
good
and
the
rock
shrimp
tempura
was
awesome
,
great
appetizer
to
share
!

I've
waited
over
one
hour
for
food
.

The
food
is
reliable
and
the
price
is
moderate
.

–
Went
there
last
night
with
a
friend
.

The
menu
consisted
of
standard
brassiere
food
,
better
then
places
like
Balthazar
etc
.

But
nonetheless--great
spot
,
great
food
.

The
pasta
was
well
cooked
,
didn't
have
enough
sauce
though
or
flavor
.

Skip
this
restaurant
,
it's
a
big
disappointment
.

Very
cozy
and
warm
inside
...

Great
food
,
amazing
service
,
this
place
is
a
class
act
.

As
always
we
had
a
great
glass
of
wine
while
we
waited
.

Rather
than
eating
the
meat
entree
being
offered
,
I
requested
a
vegetarian
dish
.

For
dinner
I
had
the
chicken
tikka-masala
and
some
garlic
naan
.

Everyone
was
smiling
so
that
made
me
feel
welcome
.

When
the
bill
came
,
he
only
took
the
discount
off
the
food
and
not
the
drinks
.

Mama
Mia
–
I
live
in
the
neighborhood
and
feel
lucky
to
live
by
such
a
great
pizza
place
.

Amazing
Spanish
Mackeral
special
appetizer
and
perfect
box
sushi
(
that
eel
with
avodcao
-
-
um
um
um
)
.

I
just
read
Mocaramel's
review
and
felt
compelled
to
respond
.

Food
was
good
and
appetizing
.

As
it
turns
out
the
owner
was
seated
right
next
to
us
and
when
he
came
over
to
check
on
our
problems
was
very
dismissive
and
offered
a
token
20
%
discount
on
our
bill
.

Keep
up
the
good
work
guys
!

Great
pizza
for
lunch
place
.

Excellent
dumplings
served
amid
clean
,
chic
decor
.

Food
was
okay
,
nothing
great
.

We
were
worried
we
would
have
trouble
getting
in
,
but
somehow
managed
to
have
a
short
wait
.

–
This
place
is
unbelievably
over-rated
.

Everything
was
going
good
until
we
got
our
meals
.

The
counter
service
is
bad
.

Anyways
,
if
you're
in
the
neighborhood
to
eat
good
food
,
I
wouldn't
waste
my
time
trying
to
find
something
,
rather
go
across
the
street
to
Tamari
.

We
have
been
to
this
place
many
times
,
and
always
have
great
food
,
wine
,
and
service
.

In
fact
,
many
want
to
return
a
second
time
during
their
visit
.

Fish
was
overdone
.

not
too
fine
thought
that
you
feel
uncomfortable
and
have
to
dress
up
.

We
had
the
lobster
sandwich
and
it
was
FANTASTIC
.

For
those
of
you
who
don't
know
,
Uni
is
Sea
Urchin
in
Japanese
,
which
happens
to
be
my
favorite
.
)

–
I
can't
say
enough
about
this
place
.

Big
Wong
is
a
great
place
to
eat
and
fill
your
stomach
.

Personal
pans
are
the
perfect
size
for
those
hungry
nights
.

Whenever
you
need
a
Sushi
fix
,
Mizu
will
be
there
with
quality
fish
and
great
service
.

I
recommend
the
jelly
fish
,
drunken
chicken
and
the
soupy
dumplings
,
certainly
the
stir
fry
blue
crab
.

For
me
dishes
a
little
oily
,
but
overall
dining
experience
good
.

I
wasn't
here
for
the
pizza
so
I
can't
comment
on
that
yet
but
what
I
had
was
very
good
.

Her
sister
had
the
baklava
for
dessert
!

The
design
of
the
space
is
good
.

but
when
we
looked
at
the
menu
,
there
weren't
a
lot
of
choices
,
most
of
them
were
dumplings
in
the
appetizer
section
.

The
scallion
pancakes
and
fried
dumplings
were
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
.

I'm
going
back
.

What
more
can
you
ask
for
?

good
sake
selection
.

This
place
is
pricey
,
and
yes
,
the
food
is
worth
it
;
but
the
service
makes
you
feel
like
you
should
be
paying
a
quater
of
the
price
.

Thalia
is
a
beautiful
restaurant
with
beautiful
people
serving
you
,
but
the
food
doesn't
quite
match
up
.

They
smell
like
they
stuff
them
with
old
canned
vegetables
like
the
spinach
mushroom
calzone
.

THe
Pizza
and
wine
were
excellent-the
service
too--but
what
really
MADE
this
place
was
the
backyard
dining
area
.

Great
Pizza
,
Poor
Service

It's
a
great
place
to
order
from
or
sit-in
.

THe
perfect
spot
.

Good
food
:
my
favorite
is
the
seafood
spaghetti
.

I
asked
for
a
menu
and
the
same
waitress
looked
at
my
like
I
was
insane
.

They
even
scoop
it
out
nice
(
for
those
on
a
diet
)
not
too
much
not
to
little
.

The
regular
menu
here
is
slightly
above
average
that
is
not
worth
the
snotty
attitude
that
you
receive
.

If
you're
going
to
see
Danny
Gans
or
just
staying
at
the
Mirage
,
don't
miss
this
one
.

–
My
husband
and
I
love
eating
at
Mioposto
Café
.

I
was
one
of
the
people
that
went
for
this
horrible
experience
.

I
went
home
&
looked
them
up
online
again
where
I
discovered
there
is
a
link
for
a
give
away
that
doesn't
work
so
emailed
the
restaurant
about
the
non
existent
service
&
deceptive
link
.

Service
was
quick
.

I
went
there
in
late
afternoon
for
some
bite
size
food
and
refleshment
with
my
date
.

Delivery
is
fast
too
.

Excellent
spot
for
holiday
get
togethers
with
co-workers
or
friends
that
you
haven't
seen
in
a
while
.

Got
a
date
?
Go
here
!

The
service
was
attentive
,
yet
unimposing
,
the
food
was
far
better
than
many
notorious
restaurants
in
Midtown
and
the
wine
list
is
extensive
and
well
priced
.

On
weekends
,
you
might
have
to
wait
for
couple
hours
.

I
will
go
back
to
Suan
soon
!

All
considered
,
I
have
to
say
that
Ray's
Boathouse
is
deserving
of
its
title
as
a
Seattle
institution
.

Not
a
very
fancy
place
but
very
good
Chinese
style
Indian
food
.

The
food
was
exceptional
.

Restaurants
in
manhattan
should
try
to
model
food
and
service
after
this
place
.

I'm
not
even
going
to
bother
to
describe
it
;
it
speaks
for
itself
.

Don't
waste
money
on
decor
.

Food
was
good
and
cheap
.

They
are
extremely
rude
,
not
even
apologizing
for
the
horrible
service
we
got
and
handing
us
a
bill
well
over
$
500
for
some
drinks
adn
their
pita
bread
!

Overall
,
excellent
restaurant
!

sometimes
i
get
good
food
and
ok
service
.

All
in
all
,
the
food
was
great
(
except
for
the
dessserts
)
.

I
loved
this
place
!
!

Which
of
course
is
not
real
Kobe
but
Wagyu
beef
.

Definitely
has
one
of
the
best
jukebox's
i've
seen
in
a
long
long
time
.

The
pancakes
were
certainly
inventive
but
$
8.50
for
3
-
6
"
pancakes
(
one
of
them
was
more
like
5
"
)
in
the
pancake
flight
(
sample
of
3
different
pancakes
)
is
well
over-priced
.

The
pasta
penne
was
pretty
extra
buttery
,
creamy
which
means
a
big
task
to
diggest
..
tasty
at
first
but
i
would
say
that
i
was
full
with
a
slice
of
pizza
and
7
to
count
,
penne
...
got
a
little
moody
afterwards
cause
was
stuffed
...
lol

He
has
visited
Thailand
and
is
quite
expert
on
the
cuisine
.

At
$
120
for
two
people
,
however
,
this
in
no
way
represents
value
,
unless
you're
looking
to
pay
by
the
hour
for
passive-aggressive
torture
.

However
,
once
I
received
my
predictably
mediocre
order
of
what
Dokebi
thinks
passes
as
Korean
fair
,
(
sometimes
you
have
to
settle
when
it's
your
only
option
)
,
I
got
through
about
half
my
kimchee
before
I
found
a
piece
of
random
lettuce
accompanied
by
a
far
more
disgusting
,
slimy
,
clearly
bad
piece
of
fish
skin
.

We
were
greeted
promptly
by
the
waiter
who
was
very
nice
and
cordial
.

I
had
a
grat
time
at
Jekyll
and
Hyde
!

If
you
are
in
the
area
try
The
Bagel
Shoppe
on
74th
street
which
is
3
blocks
away
on
2nd
Ave
.

Good
food
!

The
open
sesame
combo
plate
is
a
bargain
for
the
heap
of
food
given
.

–
Ray's
is
THE
place
to
go
for
high
quality
seafood
dinners
.

I
had
a
huge
group
for
my
birthday
and
we
were
well
taken
care
of
.

The
space
kind
of
feels
like
an
Alice
in
Wonderland
setting
,
without
it
trying
to
be
that
.

Surprisingly
nothing
could
be
further
from
the
truth
.

Molto
bene
!

Best
Taiwanese
food
in
NY
!

Management
should
really
take
notice
and
train
their
waitstaff
and
teach
them
some
proper
manners
.

But
Im
sure
this
was
just
an
honest
mistake
...

For
my
entrée
,
I
completely
enjoyed
the
seared
Alaskan
sea
scallops
complemented
by
chard
,
artichoke
hearts
,
fennel
,
and
pecorino
toscano
.

The
atmosphere
was
just
okay
.

first
it
took
us
a
long
time
to
find
the
place
.

A
weakness
is
the
chicken
in
the
salads
.

Once
for
dinner
and
once
for
brunch
.

Unhygienic

There
have
been
several
occasions
when
we've
just
not
gotten
some
side
dishes
we've
ordered
.

The
food
is
very
average
...
the
Thai
fusion
stuff
is
a
bit
too
sweet
,
every
thing
they
serve
is
too
sweet
here
.

I
lOVE
THIS
PLACE
!

Also
,
don't
plan
on
asking
for
your
favorite
roll
,
if
it's
not
on
the
menu
,
you
can't
have
it
.

What
a
great
place
!

so
delicious
!
!
!

Doesn't
get
any
better
than
that
.

When
we
sat
,
we
got
great
and
fast
service
.

I
live
in
the
neightborhood
and
am
a
regular
.

skip
dessert
.

I
go
out
to
eat
and
like
my
courses
,
servers
are
patient
and
never
rush
courses
or
force
another
drink
.

I
almost
hesititate
to
write
a
review
because
the
atmosphere
was
so
great
and
I
would
hate
for
it
too
become
to
crowded
.

Will
definitely
be
back
.

The
Four
Seasons
restaurant
is
a
great
experience
.

Without
the
wait
or
attitude
,
I
would
probably
go
back
,
but
there
are
just
too
many
other
restaurants
in
Brooklyn
that
are
as
good
or
better
and
don't
make
me
jump
through
hoops
.

Wish
NY
had
more
of
these
kind
of
places
:
intimate
,
superb
food
,
homey
,
top
notch
all
the
way
around
,
certainly
worth
the
wait
.

We
know
the
difference
between
and
oyster
and
bad
fish
.

Our
first
course
was
Tuna
Sashimi
with
Green
Yuzu
Sauce
.

Get
the
pepperoni
-
YUM
-
and
a
family
style
salad
.

sometimes
i
get
bad
food
and
bad
service
,
sometimes
i
get
good
good
and
bad
service
.

The
design
and
atmosphere
is
just
as
good
.

We'd
go
back
again

However
,
I
think
Jeckll
and
Hydes
t
is
one
of
those
places
that
is
fun
to
do
once
.

Everything
you
want
and
more
,
very
fresh
.

The
workers
there
also
absolutely
load
the
bagel
with
cream
cheese
(
gets
a
little
messy
)
.

I
had
to
ask
her
three
times
before
she
finally
came
back
with
the
dish
Ive
requested
.

My
chicken
was
inedible
as
there
were
so
many
fatty
lumps
which
i
had
to
keep
spitting
out
into
my
napkin
.

We
were
seated
outside
and
the
waiter
spilled
red
wine
and
hot
tea
on
myself
and
my
date
.

Out
of
the
hundreds
of
Italian
restaurants
in
Queens
,
this
is
among
the
best
.

fine
dining
restaurant
quality
.

The
food
was
good
,
the
place
was
clean
and
affordable
.

If
you
want
good
authentic
Thai
this
place
is
not
the
place
to
go
.

For
authentic
Thai
food
,
look
no
further
than
Toons
.

The
atmosphere
was
great
.

Waitstaff
are
very
friendly
.

The
side
dishes
were
passable
,
and
I
did
get
a
refill
upon
request
.

its
alright

A
few
tips
:
skip
the
turnip
cake
,
roast
pork
buns
and
egg
custards
.

wont
come
back
again
for
sure
!

the
spinach
is
fresh
,
definately
not
frozen
...

The
only
thing
the
waiters
don't
do
for
you
is
wipe
your
chin
when
you
leave
.

Kudos
to
these
guys
.

Great
Shabu
Shabu

I
also
ordered
the
Change
Mojito
,
which
was
out
of
this
world
.

Having
hunted
around
for
a
quiet
,
romantic
,
yet
not
hideously
expensive
restaurant
I
stumbled
across
reviews
for
La
Lanterna
and
gave
it
a
shot
.

I
went
here
on
a
recommendation
and
will
surely
return
time
and
time
again
.

Frankly
,
when
you
compare
what
you
can
have
here
for
lunch
,
versus
McDs
or
so
many
other
sandwich
shops
in
the
city
,
there
is
no
comparison
.

Great
friendly
service
,
Fast
seating
,
Fast
Delivery
,
Excellent
sushi
.

On
our
last
visit
,
they
skipped
over
our
name
on
the
list
,
leaving
us
waiting
an
extra
hour
for
a
table
.

I
sometimes
see
the
waiters
don't
have
enough
knowledge
of
their
dishes
.

Then
,
to
top
things
off
,
she
dropped
used
silverware
on
my
boyfriend's
jacket
and
did
not
stop
to
apologize
or
clean
the
mess
that
was
left
on
clothes
.

Try
the
sea
bass
.

Nice
value
.

We
picked
it
randomly
,
without
a
recommendation
from
someone
who
has
been
there
,
so
we
weren't
sure
what
to
expect
.

The
view
is
breathtaking
the
service
is
top
notch
...
the
ambiance
is
wonderfull
.

To
the
owners
of
Open
Sesame
...
Bravo
...
I
can't
wait
to
come
back
to
dine
at
your
restaurant
!

I
liked
the
atmosphere
very
much
but
the
food
was
not
worth
the
price
.

I
tried
a
couple
other
dishes
but
wasn't
too
impressed
.

Good
eats
.

The
fish
was
adequate
,
but
inexpertly
sliced
.

Mine
tasted
like
the
bartender
had
forgotten
to
add
the
tequila
.

Should
have
gone
to
Trader
Joe's
and
had
frozen
pizza
:(

Dessert
is
a
joke
...
dont
bother

Would
NEVER
go
back
there
.

A
fairly
late
entry
into
the
haute
barnyard
sweepstakes
,
Flatbush
Farm
isn't
in
the
same
league
as
the
Blue
Hills
or
even
the
Farm
on
Adderlys
of
the
world
,
but
it's
pretty
good
,
albeit
with
a
somewhat
dismal
setting
.

The
decor
is
very
simple
but
comfortable
.

The
only
drawback
is
that
this
place
is
really
expensive
and
the
portions
are
on
the
small
side
.

The
service
was
quick
and
friendly
.

Either
that
,
or
the
editor's
idea
of
romance
must
be
sharing
a
conversation
with
the
next
table
,
while
trying
to
speak
louder
than
the
traffic
on
57th
.

the
last
time
i
walked
by
it
looked
pretty
empty
.
hmmm
.

The
appetizer
of
oysters
,
lobster
,
crab
(
small
size
)
made
a
perfect
entre
for
my
wife
.

Definitely
worth
the
trip
to
Battery
Park
City
!

The
vibe
is
very
relaxed
and
cozy
,
service
was
great
and
the
food
was
excellent
!

Good
luck
getting
a
table
.

not
chewy
at
all
.

The
sake
menu
should
not
be
overlooked
!

I
would
recommend
to
ask
for
a
bigger
sitting
area
when
you
make
a
reservation
(
if
possible
)

Highly
recommended
to
all
!

They
honored
reservation
on
Sunday
afternoon
very
well
.

The
porcini
mushroom
pasta
special
was
tasteless
,
so
was
the
seafood
tagliatelle
.

I
go
twice
a
month
!

This
place
has
got
to
be
the
best
japanese
restaurant
in
the
new
york
area
.

I
can't
believe
people
complain
about
no
cheese
sticks
?

We
took
advanatage
of
the
half
price
sushi
deal
on
saturday
so
it
was
well
worth
it
.

–
In
a
age
of
incremental
cost
cutting
in
restaurants
,
its
nice
to
see
a
place
that
bucks
that
trend
,
and
just
plain
delivers
high
quality
food
and
good
service
,
period
.

Been
there
,
done
that
,
and
New
York
,
it's
not
that
big
a
deal
.

We
were
charged
full
price
.

We
weren't
!

Finally
a
meal
that
you
will
remember
for
a
long
time
!

I
have
been
to
Casimir
over
5
times
and
I
have
always
had
a
great
time
there
.

Bukhara
Grill
,
the
tagline
says
it
all
..
"
INDIAN
SPICE
RAVE
"

Our
waiter
was
non-existent
and
after
our
food
finally
arrived
over
an
hour
after
we
ordered
,
we
were
not
given
any
water
or
utensils
.

Atmosphere
is
nice
and
relaxed
too
...

The
upside
of
the
restaurant
?

The
appetizer
was
interesting
,
but
the
Creme
Brulee
was
very
savory
and
delicious
.

You

Best
Crab
Cakes
in
Town

They
have
all
been
tonight
and
they
have
all
been
about
the
same
restaurant
.

The
food
was
very
good
,
filet
mignon
was
probably
the
best
I've
ever
try
.

The
portions
are
big
though
,
so
do
not
order
too
much
.

From
the
street
it
looks
very
hidden
,
and
is
actually
an
old
warehouse
.

I
had
the
Kafta
plate
and
it
was
perfect
.

The
waitress
appeared
and
asked
us
if
we
wanted
to
go
ahead
and
order
.

Ahhh
...

The
most
pleasant
surprise
was
the
check
that
did
not
exceed
my
expectations
as
it
always
happens
in
most
of
the
places
.

We
had
Pam's
special
fried
fish
and
it
was
amazing
.

MMMMMMMMMmmmmmm
so
delicious

The
rice
to
fish
ration
was
also
good--they
didn't
try
to
overpack
the
rice
.

If
you
ware
looking
for
Korean
fusion
,
I
suggest
you
try
some
of
the
places
in
the
East
Village
.

This
is
a
great
place
to
take
out-of-towners
,
and
perfect
for
watching
the
sunset
.

–
The
atmosphere
is
great
for
any
special
occasion
you
might
want
to
celebrate
.

The
rolls
are
creative
and
I
have
yet
to
find
another
sushi
place
that
serves
up
more
inventive
yet
delicious
japanese
food
.

Was
there
Friday
night
.

I
would
defiantly
come
back
here
again
as
one
of
my
top
choices
.

I
book
a
gorgeous
white
organza
tent
which
included
a
four
course
prix
fix
menu
which
we
enjoyed
a
lot
.

I
have
been
living
in
NYC
for
bit
now
and
I
have
to
say
I
love
to
go
out
and
explore
the
scene
.

I
recommend
this
place
to
everyone
.

The
only
thing
that
my
friend
left
out
is
that
when
we
sat
down
at
the
bar
the
bartender
disappeared
.

It
costs
$
2
extra
to
turn
a
regular
roll
into
an
inside-out
roll
,
but
the
roll
more
than
triples
in
size
,
and
that's
not
just
from
the
rice
.

Best
Mexican
place
for
lunch
in
the
financial
district
.

At
this
point
,
the
waitress
comes
over
and
asks
us
if
everything
was
okay
,
I
was
literally
so
shocked
that
I
was
speechless
and
didn't
say
anything
,
and
guess
what
,
the
waitress
WALKED
away
.

im
not
necessarily
fanatical
about
this
place
,
but
it
was
a
fun
time
for
low
pirces
.

All
in
all
the
food
was
good
-
a
little
on
the
expensive
side
,
but
fresh
.

plus
,
i
am
allergic
to
rice
,
and
the
waitstaff
was
unbelievably
accomodating
-
-
didn't
even
bat
an
eye
!

The
food
is
okay
and
the
prices
here
are
mediocre
.

Although
we
were
told
10-15
minutes
and
it
was
more
like
45
minutes
.

However
,
most
of
them
are
at
least
prompt
and
pleasant
.

The
sauce
tasted
more
like
Chinese
fast
food
than
decent
Korean
.

Very
pleased

We
had
a
good
time
.

This
little
place
definitely
exceeded
my
expectations
and
you
sure
get
a
lot
of
food
for
your
money
.

This
is
such
a
lovely
,
peaceful
place
to
eat
outside
.

The
menu
looked
great
,
and
the
waiter
was
very
nice
,
but
when
the
food
came
,
it
was
average
.

Nice
ambience
,
but
highly
overrated
place
.

Some
of
the
food
is
clearly
oriented
toward
foodies
(
like
me
)
so
if
your
not
a
foodie
(
nothing
wrong
with
that
)
-
head
over
to
McDonalds
or
some
Ruby
Tuesday
and
have
at
it
!

Seattle's

It's
simply
the
best
meal
in

.

Just
go
to

and
order
the
Red

Everything
about
this
restaurant
was
special
.

The
service
was
excellent
,
the
coffee
was
good
even
by
starbucks
standards
and
the
food
was
outstanding
.

The
buffet
had
a
nice
selection
.

The
lunch
menu
is
an
awesome
deal
!

The
family
seafood
entree
was
very
good
.

We
had
the
scallops
as
an
appetizer
and
they
were
delicious
and
the
sauce
was
wonderful
.

Excellent
food
,
nice
ambience
,
fairly
expensive

Don
’
t
go
to
this
place
!

I
appreciate
their
delivery
too
.

Just

to
the
neighborhood
and
we've
been
trying
all
the

Sushi
restaurants
.

VERY
GOOD
!

The
outside
patio
area
has
an
abbreviated
menu
.

For
desserts
,
we
tried
the
frozen
black
sesame
mousse
(
interesting
but
not
extraordinary
)
and
matcha
(
powdered
green
tea
)
and
blueberry
cheesecake
,
which
was
phenomenal
.

(
that
is
A
MUST
,
but
not
every
restaurant
can
do
...
)

Delicious
crab
cakes
too
.

bottles
of
wine
are
cheap
and
good
.

I
swore
never
to
return
for
a
warm
beer
and
mediocre
meal
.

Oh
,
and
the
cheese
fries
are
awesome
!

(
Always
ask
the
bartender
for
the
SEASONAL
beer
!
!
!

It's
boring
on
the
inside
,
and
our
sushi
was
pretty
below
average
...
the
tuna
was
soggy
and
the
other
rolls
had
no
flavor
.

The
wine
list
is
extensive
and
can
easily
hike
up
an
otherwise
reasonably
priced
meal
.

I
can't
saybenough
good
things
about
this
restaurant
,
and
I
can't
wait
for
my
next
several
visits
.

We
ordered
our
appetizers
,
I
ordered
the
chicken
and
my
boyfriend
the
salmon
.

–
I
will
never
forget
the
amazing
meal
,
service
,
and
ambiance
I
experience
at
this
restaurant
.

The
hostess
was
rude
and
I
got
a
distinct
feeling
that
they
did
not
want
to
serve
us
.

I
loved
it
and
would
go
again
.

Food
is
usually
very
good
,
though
ocasionally
I
wondered
about
freshmess
of
raw
vegatables
in
side
orders
.

Not
the
biggest
portions
but
adequate
.

But
,
they
were
too
big
for
the
bun
.

The
service
was
extremely
fast
and
attentive
(
thanks
to
the
service
button
on
your
table
)
but
I
barely
understood
1
word
when
the
waiter
took
our
order
.

Guess
what
,
I
waited
for
TWENTY
minutes
before
she
came
over
and
when
she
finally
did
,
she
says
,
"
oh
well
,
I
wish
you
would
have
said
something
earlier
"
No
apology
,
nothing
.

I
went
there
with
my
friend
last
saturday
.

You
are
not
eating
haut
cuisine
with
subtle
hints
of
whatever
but
:
Cassuolet
,
Steake

,

,
etc
;
simple
stuff
.

There
are
other
people
waiting
!

This
restaurant
was
recommended
by
a
local
...
as
a
matter
of
fact
,
he
made
the
reservation
for
us
and
said
we
would
not
be
disappointed
!

Every
time
I
have
a
special
occasion
with
my
boyfriend
I
have
a
hard
time
going
anywhere
else
.

This
place
is
great
.

awesome
find

And
I
hate
to
say
this
but
I
doubt
I'll
ever
go
back
.

Two
complaints
-
their
appetizer
selection
stinks
,
it
would
be
nice
to
get
some
mozzarella
sticks
on
the
menu
.

You
will
find
yourself
returning
quite
often
.

Better
than
nobu
,
tomoe
,
taka
,
yama
,
sugiyama
,
and
the
rest
.

Sunday
afternoons
there
is
a
band
playing
and
it
is
lots
of
fun
.

What
more
could
you
want
?

Awesome

I'm
not
kidding
.

The
large
selection
of
bruschettas
,
paninis
,
tramezzinis
keep
the
palate
from
stagnating
.

We've
found
it
to
be
better
and
fresher
than
Kiku
which
is
comparable
in
price
.

We
arrived
and
were
seated
immediately
,
which
made
us
both
happy
.

Who
has
room
for
Cheesesticks
with
the
best
pizza
in
NYC
!

She
just
nodded
and
walked
off
.

This
was
my
frist
time
at
Cafe
St
.
Bart's
and
I
must
say
how
delicous
the
food
and
the
service
was
.

I
LOVE
their
Thai

Nice
atmosphere
,
the
service
was
very
pleasant
and
the
desert
was
good
.

the
crust
was
imazingly
cooked
well
and
pizza
was
fully
loaded
:)
:)
:)

I
was
here
a
few
weeks
back
and
we
had
the
worst
customer
service
experience
at
a
restaurant
ever
.

The
owner
truly
caters
to
all
your
needs
.

Try
the
Pad
Thai
,
or
sample
anything
on
the
appetizer
menu
...
they're
all
delicious
.

food
...
there
are
tons
of
restaurants
in
NY
...
stay
away
from
this
one

A
quintessential
slice
of
NYC
pizza
.

Slightly
on
the
pricey
side
but
worth
it
!

They
all
know
you
.

Our
visit
their
to
say
the
least
,
was
an
unpleasant
and
costly
experience
!

Overrated

We
ordered
a
selection
of
the
small
plates
,
and
the
shoe
string
onions
,
goat
cheese
pizza
,
grilled
asparagus
and
fried
brie
with
fruit
were
all
very
good
.

Skip
this
location
and
go
to
the
one
in
Soho
.

Celebrated
my
fathers
birthday
here
.

If
you
venture
off
the
island
of
Manhattan
and
can't
seem
to
find
a
great
Italian
restaurant
,
drive
to
Corona
.

Nothing
really
came
across
as
outstanding
.

I
was
shocked
that
my
friends
wanted
to
stay
after
the
waitress
said
,
"
can
I
help
you
"
and
"
how
many
are
in
your
party
.
"

Oh
I
forgot
to
mention
that
they
don't
have
bread
service
.

The
rice
was
poor
quality
and
was
cooked
so
badly
it
was
hard
.

The
setting
is
casual
and
romantic
.

i
know
,
you
were
too
busy
showing
off
your
vintage
tee
shirt
and
looking
bored
,
but
my
agenda
is
i'm
here
to
eat
and
enjoy
the
company
of
friends
,
seeking
a
pleasant
experience
.

The
atmosphere
is
relaxed
and
casual
.

And
even
more
so
unpleasant
because
it
was
so
costly
for
such
an
unpleasant
experience
.

The
presentation
of
Snooze
is
excellent
and
it
is
one
of
those
places
that
you
feel
more
sophisticated
just
for
being
there
;
but
peel
back
the
layers
and
you
have
an
overpriced
IHOP
with
a
high
brow
menu
.

I
highly
recommend
this
beautiful
place
.

Price
is
high
but
the
food
is
good
,
so
I
would
come
back
again
.

Service
is
fast
and
friendly
.

I
would
never
recommend
this
place
to
anybody
even
for
a
casual
dinner
.

The
food
is
not
what
it
once
was
(
potions
have
seriously
seen
downsizing
)
prices
have
gone
up
,
and
the
service
is
the
worst
I
have
experienced
anywhere
(
including
mainland
Europe
)
.

I
have
worked
in
restaurants
and
cook
a
lot
,
and
there
is
no
way
a
maggot
should
be
able
to
get
into
well
prepared
food
.

If
you've
ever
been
along
the
river
in
Weehawken
you
have
an
idea
of
the
top
of
view
the
chart
house
has
to
offer
.

I
highly
recommend
the
fish
tacos
,
everything
else
was
ok
.

Food
took
some
time
to
prepare
,
all
worth
waiting
for
.

the
drinks
are
amazing
and
half
off
till
8p
m
.

Five
of
us
walked
in
at
approximately
6:20
on
a
Thursday
evening
.

Be
sure
not
to
get
anything
other
than
bagels
!
..

I
showed
it
to
the
manager
,
and
he
smilingly
apologized
and
brought
us
two
free
desserts
(
but
did
not
ask
us
what
we
wanted
and
so
brought
the
last
two
desserts
we
would
have
asked
for
)
.

Helpful
service
and
average
price
per
dish
$
10
.

Best
drumsticks
over
rice
and
sour
spicy
soup
in
town
!

Each
time
we've
been
,
the
front
of
house
staff
(
not
the
waiters
-
they're
fantastic
-
but
the
people
who
greet
and
seat
you
)
has
been
so
hideous
to
us
that
were
it
not
for
the
exceptional
fish
dishes
I
would
never
return
.

Have
frequented
'
ino
for
several
years
and
the
food
remains
excellent
.

The
service
was
impeccable
and
unobtrusive
-
-
the
staff
knows
what
they
are
there
to
do
-
-
to
know
their
menu
,
present
your
meal
,
and
attend
to
your
needs
.

While
it
is
understandable
that
every
place
is
indeed
different
,
there
was
not
a
need
to
be
uncourteous
to
customers
and
downright
rude
.

The
wait
staff
is
very
freindly
,
they
make
it
feel
like
you're
eating
in
a
freindly
little
european
town
.

Shame
on
this
place
for
the
horrible
rude
staff
and
non-existent
customer
service
.

Service
was
also
horrible
and
the
ambience
is
not
that
great
.

The
onion
rings
are
great
!

I
am
actually
offended
to
have
spent
so
much
money
on
such
a
bad

either

Old
Reliable

How
this
place
survives
the
competitive
west
village
market
in
this
economy
,
or
any
other
for
that
matter
,
is
beyond
me
.

They
are
not
greasy
or
anything
.

The
only
thing
more
wonderful
than
the
food
(
which
is
exceptional
)
is
the
service
.

This
place
is
the
most
Japanese
it
can
ever
get
.

One
of
the
best
,
if
not
THE
best
,
restaurants
in
Park
Slope
(
and
NY
in
general
)

Calling
the
place
Hampton
Chutney
Co
.
does
warn
you
that
these
folks
offer
more
style
than
substance
,
but
in
this
unattractive
room
with
unhelpful
clerks
there
was
a
dearth
of
the
former
too
.

The
ambience
is
pretty
and
nice
for
conversation
,
so
a
casual
lunch
here
would
probably
be
best
.

Maybe
I'll
go
back
once
more
many
years
from
now
when
I've
forgotten
I
went
there
already
.

In
the
end
our
check
came
to
$
27
for
4
small
pancakes
,
a
breakfast
burrito
,
an
orange
juice
and
an
iced
tea
(
I
had
water
)
.

I
will
NEVER
return
.

Went
to
Village
last
night
for
my
birthday
.

Be
prepared
to
wait
,
because
the
place
is
pretty
tiny
.

My
chow
fun
and
chow
see
was
really
bland
and
oily
.

not
sure
why
this
restaurant
would
be
rated
that
highly
.
