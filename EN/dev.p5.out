We O
were O
then O
charged O
for O
their O
most O
expensive O
sake O
( O
$ O
20 O
+ O
per O
serving O
) O
when O
we O
in O
fact O
drank O
a O
sake O
of O
less O
than O
half O
that O
price O
. O

Amma O
is O
nothing O
special O
. O

Great O
atmoshere O
and O
worth O
every O
bit O
. O

delicious O
bagels O
, O
especially O
when O
right O
out O
of O
the O
oven O
. O

Go O
here O
. O

Highly O
recommended O
! O

But O
who O
says O
Murray's O
is O
anything O
about O
service O
. O

The O
atmosphere O
was O
mostly O
of O
an O
older O
crowd O
, O
but O
there O
were O
a O
few O
groups O
of O
mid O
20 O
' O
s O
/ O
30 O
year O
olds O
also O
. O

Just O
straight O
up O
cheap O
, O
good O
food O
. O

The O
service O
was O
terrible O
, O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
everything O
and O
ask O
several O
of O
different O
people O
for O
the O
same O
thing O
before O
we O
were O
allowed O
to O
be O
served O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
place O
to O
get O
a O
delicious O
meal O
. O

Um O
so O
now O
what O
are O
appetizers O
for O
? O
? O
? O

I O
agree O
that O
dining O
at O
Casa O
La O
Femme O
is O
like O
no O
other O
dining O
experience O
! O

It O
wasn't O
the O
freshest O
seafood O
ever O
, O
but O
the O
taste O
and O
presentation O
was O
OK O
. O

They O
have O
authentic O
Indian O
at O
amazin O
prices O
. O

The O
food O
was O
delicious O
( O
I O
had O
a O
halibut O
special O
, O
my O
husband O
had O
steak O
) O
, O
and O
the O
service O
was O
top-notch O
. O

the O
food O
is O
decent O
. O

i O
am O
never O
disappointed O
with O
there O
food O
. O

everyone O
was O
cheerfully O
cooperative O
and O
helpful O
. O

the O
bus O
boy O
even O
spotted O
that O
my O
table O
was O
shaking O
a O
stabilized O
it O
for O
me O
. O

– O
This O
place O
is O
famous O
for O
their O
breakfast O
. O

When O
I O
got O
there O
I O
sat O
up O
stairs O
where O
the O
atmosphere O
was O
cozy O
& O
the O
service O
was O
horrible O
! O

It O
is O
set O
far O
from O
the O
small O
street O
it's O
on O
, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
traffic O
noise O
. O

– O
Save O
yourself O
the O
waste O
of O
time O
& O
DO O
NOT O
visit O
. O

Recommendations O
, O
of O
course O
, O
are O
required O
! O

Also O
they O
were O
$ O
15 O
each O
! O

Two O
thumbs O
up O
! O

This O
guy O
refused O
to O
seat O
her O
and O
she O
left O
, O
followed O
shortly O
by O
the O
four O
of O
us O
, O
but O
not O
before O
I O
told O
him O
that O
in O
my O
40 O
years O
of O
world O
travel O
, O
including O
Paris O
, O
that O
I O
had O
never O
seen O
such O
a O
display O
of O
bad O
behavior O
by O
a O
frontman O
in O
a O
restaurant O
. O

I O
really O
liked O
this O
place O
. O

The O
filet O
mignon O
dish O
was O
superb O
! O

Lucky O
Strike O
is O
a O
great O
casual O
place O
to O
just O
grab O
a O
bite O
to O
eat O
. O

I O
have O
never O
been O
so O
disgusted O
by O
both O
food O
an O
service O
. O

So O
, O
if O
you're O
walking O
by O
and O
thinking O
about O
dining O
, O
you O
might O
want O
to O
see O
who's O
going O
to O
be O
seating O
you O
first O
... O

Good O
for O
late O
night O
dining O
( O
last O
minute O
planning O
) O
without O
reservations O
. O

Expensive O

The O
pizza O
is O
delicious O
- O
they O
use O
fresh O
mozzarella O
instead O
of O
the O
cheap O
, O
frozen O
, O
shredded O
cheese O
common O
to O
most O
pizzaria's O
. O

service O
is O
friendly O
, O
and O
never O
had O
a O
problem O
walking O
in O
and O
getting O
a O
table O
. O

I O
can't O
remember O
the O
last O
time O
I O
had O
such O
gross O
food O
in O
New O
York O
. O

The O
only O
beverage O
we O
did O
receive O
was O
water O
in O
dirty O
glasses O
! O

Can't O
wait O
to O
go O
back O
. O

Guacamole O
+ O
shrimp O
appetizer O
was O
really O
great O
, O
we O
both O
had O
the O
filet O
, O
very O
good O
, O
didn't O
much O
like O
the O
frites O
that O
came O
with O
, O
but O
the O
filet O
was O
so O
good O
, O
neither O
of O
us O
cared O
. O

The O
wine O
list O
is O
excellent O
. O

I O
had O
Lobster O
Bisque O
it O
has O
2 O
oz O
. O
of O
Maine O
Lobster O
in O
it O
. O

The O
hostess O
was O
very O
pleasant O
. O

The O
best O
thing O
is O
, O
the O
prices O
are O
also O
quite O
reasonable O
. O

I O
won't O
go O
back O
unless O
someone O
else O
is O
footing O
the O
bill O
. O

The O
main O
entree O
was O
also O
very O
good O
. O

Great O
place O
, O
great O
value O
. O

The O
food O
is O
fantastic O
, O
and O
the O
waiting O
staff O
has O
been O
perfect O
every O
single O
time O
we've O
been O
there O
. O

Both O
times O
I O
was O
extremely O
dissappointed O
by O
the O
service O
, O
which O
was O
boarderline O
rude O
. O

Just O
went O
here O
for O
my O
girlfriends O
23rd O
bday O
. O

I O
am O
going O
to O
the O
mid O
town O
location O
next O
. O

delicious O
simple O
food O
in O
nice O
outdoor O
atmosphere O
. O

Less O
than O
three O
minutes O
passed O
before O
I O
found O
myself O
doubled O
over O
the O
toilet O
. O

The O
omlette O
for O
brunch O
is O
great O
... O

The O
level O
of O
rudeness O
was O
preposterous O
. O

I'm O
still O
mad O
that O
i O
had O
to O
pay O
for O
lousy O
food O
. O

Love O
the O
scene O
first O
off O
- O
the O
place O
has O
a O
character O
and O
nice O
light O
to O
it O
.. O
very O
fortunate O
, O
location O
wise O
. O

The O
atmosphere O
was O
pretty O
nice O
but O
had O
a O
bit O
lacking O
, O
which O
it O
tries O
to O
make O
up O
for O
with O
a O
crazy O
scheme O
of O
mirrors O
. O

The O
in-house O
lady O
DJ O
on O
Saturday O
nights O
has O
outrageously O
good O
taste O
in O
music O
, O
and O
moreover O
, O
takes O
requests O
. O

A O
pleasant O
surprise O
. O

The O
food O
arrived O
in O
about O
15 O
minutes O
. O

Their O
sake O
list O
was O
extensive O
, O
but O
we O
were O
looking O
for O
Purple O
Haze O
, O
which O
wasn't O
listed O
but O
made O
for O
us O
upon O
request O
! O

i O
don't O
usually O
order O
wine O
with O
indian O
so O
i O
can't O
comment O
on O
their O
wine O
list O
or O
their O
wines O
. O

Authentic O
Pakistani O
food O
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
this O
midtown O
gem O
instantly O
became O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
sushi O
restaurants O
in O
the O
city O
. O

Not O
the O
typical O
NYC O
gimmick O
theme O
restaurant O
. O

I O
complete O
the O
total O
bagel O
experience O
by O
having O
it O
lightly O
toasted O
. O

We O
had O
a O
very O
nice O
time O
. O

My O
family O
ate O
here O
last O
weekend O
. O

We O
live O
nearby O
BFC O
. O

While O
it's O
not O
Nobu O
, O
it O
sure O
is O
a O
great O
deal O
and O
you O
definitely O
will O
leave O
feeling O
satisfied O
and O
full O
. O

So O
for O
the O
' O
after O
beach O
excursion O
' O
, O
we O
thought O
we O
would O
end O
the O
day O
on O
a O
high O
note O
and O
make O
the O
trip O
across O
the O
street O
from O
the O
beach O
to O
Park O
Chalet O
. O

The O
one O
on O
the O
east O
side O
is O
much O
better O
than O
the O
one O
on O
the O
west O
side O
. O

Nice O
Family O
owned O
traditional O
restaurant O
. O

I O
lived O
on O
50th O
st O
, O
and O
wanted O
Indian O
one O
day O
so O
decided O
to O
check O
this O
place O
out O
. O

Our O
experience O
did O
not O
ever O
get O
any O
better O
. O

I O
don O
’ O
t O
usually O
visit O
the O
same O
establishment O
more O
than O
once O
, O
what O
more O
twice O
, O
but O
I O
’ O
ll O
come O
to O
Zenkichi O
anytime O
for O
a O
quiet O
, O
unhurried O
and O
memorable O
dinner O
. O

and O
yes O
Dal O
Bukhara O
is O
so O
dam O
good O
and O
so O
are O
all O
the O
kababs O
. O

The O
pizza O
’ O
s O
are O
not O
huge O
and O
the O
crust O
is O
thin O
… O
keep O
that O
in O
mind O
when O
you O
’ O
re O
ordering O
. O

Ciao O
Bella O

Food O
was O
good O
not O
great O
not O
worth O
the O
wait O
or O
another O
visit O

Even O
my O
Indian O
friend O
couldn't O
believe O
how O
good O
and O
tasty O
everything O
was O
. O

My O
friend O
devoured O
her O
chicken O
and O
mashed O
potatos O
. O

The O
pizza O
itself O
is O
not O
exactly O
the O
best O
I've O
had O
EVER O
, O
but O
still O
pretty O
good O
. O

Terrible O
, O
terrible O
management O
- O
deserves O
to O
be O
shut-down O
. O

It's O
a O
small O
cute O
restaurant O
. O

I O
felt O
as O
though O
I O
were O
eating O
in O
Paris O
. O

the O
salads O
are O
delicious O
, O
both O
refreshing O
and O
very O
spicy O
. O

Worth O
visiting O
the O
1st O
Ave O
spot O
because O
it O
is O
the O
original O
store O
. O

This O
is O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
restaurants O
and O
it O
is O
not O
to O
be O
missed O
. O

The O
entertainment O
was O
great O
they O
have O
shows O
that O
go O
on O
through O
out O
the O
dinner O
. O

– O
The O
food O
was O
not O
great O
& O
the O
waiters O
were O
rude O
. O

Whether O
it's O
the O
parmesean O
porcini O
souffle O
or O
the O
lamb O
glazed O
with O
balsamic O
vinegar O
, O
you O
will O
surely O
be O
transported O
to O
Northern O
Italy O
with O
one O
bite O
. O

The O
food O
options O
rule O
. O

Mussles O
and O
calamari O
were O
superb O
Saturday O
evening O
. O

AMAZING O
. O

I O
went O
there O
after O
hearing O
how O
great O
it O
was O
. O

The O
floor O
was O
wet O
, O
the O
trash O
can O
filled O
with O
hand O
towels O
n O
all O
over O
the O
floor O
, O
no O
soap O
, O
and O
no O
hand O
towels O
left O
. O

I O
was O
in O
love O
with O
Pongsri O
on O
48th O
, O
but O
compared O
to O
Suan O
it O
is O
slow O
in O
service O
and O
overpriced O
. O

The O
waitress O
was O
very O
patient O
with O
us O
and O
the O
food O
is O
phenomenal O
! O

The O
food O
' O
s O
as O
good O
as O
ever O
. O

Go O
here O
for O
a O
romantic O
dinner O
but O
not O
for O
an O
all O
out O
wow O
dining O
experience O
. O

With O
the O
theater O
2 O
blocks O
away O
we O
had O
a O
delicious O
meal O
in O
a O
beautiful O
room O
. O

Very O
immature O
bartender O
, O
didnt O
know O
how O
to O
make O
specific O
drinks O
, O
service O
was O
so O
slowwwww O
, O
the O
food O
was O
not O
fresh O
or O
warm O
, O
waitresses O
were O
busy O
flirting O
with O
men O
at O
the O
bar O
and O
werent O
very O
attentive O
to O
all O
the O
customers O
. O

The O
food O
is O
excellent O
! O

My O
wife O
had O
barely O
touched O
that O
mess O
of O
a O
dish O
. O

Ambience O
is O
delightful O
, O
service O
impeccable O
. O

The O
place O
is O
a O
BISTRO O
which O
means O
: O
simple O
dishes O
and O
wine O
served O
efficiently O
in O
a O
bustling O
atmosphere O
. O

Great O
neighborhood O
joint O
. O

What O
you O
are O
paying O
for O
is O
the O
environment O
and O
the O
name O
. O

The O
dishes O
offered O
were O
unique O
, O
very O
tasty O
and O
fresh O
from O
the O
lamb O
sausages O
, O
sardines O
with O
biscuits O
, O
large O
whole O
shrimp O
to O
the O
amazing O
pistachio O
ice O
cream O
( O
the O
best O
and O
freshest O
I've O
ever O
had O
) O
. O

Don't O
leave O
the O
restaurant O
without O
it O
. O

Quite O
simply O
it's O
like O
stepping O
out O
of O
Manhattan O
and O
into O
a O
haven O
of O
tranquility O
. O

I O
was O
literally O
going O
to O
explode O
, O
but O
instead O
, O
my O
boyfriend O
took O
the O
bill O
and O
went O
to O
find O
the O
manager O
. O

This O
is O
the O
BEST O
Shabu-Shabu O
Restaurant O
in O
the O
Try-State O
Area O
. O

Try O
the O
crunchy O
tuna O
, O
it O
is O
to O
die O
for O
. O

– O
I O
can't O
believe O
Murphy's O
has O
been O
around O
for O
over O
25 O
years O
, O
amazing O
. O

The O
food O
is O
good O
, O
I O
can't O
lie O
. O

Me O
and O
my O
girls O
will O
definitely O
go O
back O
. O

Delectable O

Raga's O
is O
a O
romantic O
, O
cozy O
restaurant O
. O

Great O
place O
to O
relax O
and O
enjoy O
your O
dinner O

So O
here O
we O
are O
, O
my O
wife O
, O
3 O
year O
old O
daughter O
and O
I O
trying O
to O
pass O
the O
time O
by O
hanging O
out O
in O
the O
front O
of O
the O
building O
( O
where O
the O
murals O
and O
artifacts O
are O
) O
. O

Excellent O
food O
for O
great O
prices O

Once O
we O
finally O
got O
a O
table O
, O
despite O
indicating O
we O
wanted O
an O
alla O
carte O
menu O
we O
were O
pushed O
into O
a O
table O
that O
was O
only O
price O
fixed O
! O

I O
have O
to O
say O
I O
have O
never O
had O
a O
disapointing O
meal O
here O
. O

i O
would O
just O
ask O
for O
no O
oil O
next O
time O
. O

Slightly O
above O
average O
wines O
start O
at O
$ O
70 O
+ O
with O
only O
one O
selection O
listed O
at O
$ O
30 O
+ O
. O

At O
first O
glance O
this O
place O
seems O
a O
bit O
pricey O
for O
a O
hot O
dog O
joint O
, O
but O
at O
Bark O
you O
don't O
just O
get O
your O
average O
hot O
dog O
. O

Admittedly O
some O
nights O
inside O
the O
restaurant O
were O
rather O
warm O
, O
but O
the O
open O
kitchen O
is O
part O
of O
the O
charm O
. O

We O
had O
a O
great O
time O
at O
the O
Jekyll O
and O
hyde O
Pub O
last O
night O
. O

An O
awesome O
organic O
dog O
, O
and O
a O
conscious O
eco O
friendly O
establishment O
. O

You O
can O
get O
a O
completely O
delish O
martini O
in O
a O
glass O
( O
that's O
about O
2 O
1/2 O
drinks O
) O
for O
$ O
8.50 O
( O
I O
recommend O
the O
Vanilla O
Shanty O
, O
mmmm O
! O
) O
in O
a O
great O
homey O
setting O
with O
great O
music O
. O

But O
the O
space O
is O
small O
and O
lovely O
, O
and O
the O
service O
is O
helpful O
. O

Poor O
service O
and O
management O

$ O
500 O
included O
: O

The O
veal O
was O
incredible O
last O
night O
. O

Great O
service O
, O
great O
food O
. O

I've O
been O
to O
at O
Cafe O
Spice O
probably O
5-8 O
times O
, O
it O
is O
probably O
still O
the O
best O
Indian O
restaurant O
around O
Union O
Square O
. O

The O
service O
was O
attentive O
. O

Tiny O
dessert O
was O
$ O
8.00 O
... O
just O
plain O
overpriced O
for O
what O
it O
is O
. O

Our O
family O
never O
expected O
such O
incredible O
entertainment O
in O
a O
restaurant O
. O

Delicious O
, O
creative O
and O
fun O
. O

WOW O
! O
! O
! O

Very O
good O
wine O
choices O
. O

I've O
eaten O
at O
many O
different O
Indian O
restaurants O
. O

Interesting O
selection O
, O
good O
wines O
, O
service O
fine O
, O
fun O
decor O
. O

The O
food O
was O
delicious O
but O
do O
not O
come O
here O
on O
a O
empty O
stomach O
. O

The O
crust O
is O
thin O
, O
the O
ingredients O
are O
fresh O
and O
the O
staff O
is O
friendly O
. O

– O
This O
is O
my O
" O
must O
bring O
out O
of O
town O
guests O
to O
" O
restaurant O
and O
they O
always O
enjoy O
and O
rave O
about O
it O
. O

I O
didn't O
complain O
, O
I O
liked O
the O
atmosphere O
so O
much O
. O

There O
is O
a O
downside O
if O
you're O
ordering O
in O
- O
- O
the O
delivery O
guys O
have O
MAJOR O
attitude O
. O

You O
cannot O
go O
wrong O
with O
this O
place O
. O

The O
food O
is O
delicious O
- O
from O
the O
specials O
to O
the O
regular O
menu-fare O
, O
the O
dishes O
are O
never O
a O
disappointment O
. O

However O
, O
if O
you O
want O
great O
food O
at O
a O
great O
price O
and O
don't O
mind O
the O
decor O
, O
you O
can't O
beat O
this O
place O
. O

Being O
serious O
sushi O
lovers O
, O
we O
sat O
at O
the O
sushi O
bar O
to O
be O
closer O
to O
the O
action O
. O

Add O
to O
that O
great O
service O
and O
great O
food O
at O
a O
reasonable O
price O
and O
you O
have O
yourself O
the O
beginning O
of O
a O
great O
evening O
. O

I O
would O
go O
back O
. O

Hats O
off O
to O
the O
chef O
. O

My O
main O
concern O
was O
the O
sanity O
of O
the O
food O
that O
was O
being O
sent O
out O
to O
myself O
and O
others O
, O
but O
I O
would O
be O
lying O
is O
I O
said O
that O
as O
someone O
who O
has O
worked O
in O
restaurants O
since O
the O
age O
of O
fifteen O
I O
was O
expecting O
at O
least O
a O
minimal O
effort O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
restaurant O
to O
amend O
the O
situation O
. O

Server O
made O
several O
sake O
suggestions O
which O
were O
very O
good O
. O

It's O
great O
to O
go O
for O
a O
quick O
lunch O
either O
alone O
or O
with O
a O
friend O
. O

Great O
food O
, O
better O

Every O

everyone O
drinks O
! O

How O
do O
you O
rate O
home O
? O

The O
wine O
list O
is O
extensive O
and O
impressive O
. O

Pizza O
is O
terrific O
, O
as O
is O
homemade O
pasta O
. O

Cry O
me O
a O
river O
, O
stop O
complaining O
you O
obviously O
you O
have O
no O
taste O
in O
food O
. O

We O
stood O
there O
for O
10 O
minutes O
while O
employees O
walked O
back O
and O
forth O
ignoring O
us O
. O

For O
a O
restaurant O
with O
such O
a O
good O
reputation O
and O
that O
is O
usually O
so O
packed O
, O
there O
was O
no O
reason O
for O
such O
a O
lack O
of O
intelligent O
customer O
service O
. O

we O
were O
tired O
and O
cold O
when O
we O
got O
to O
the O
restaurant O
, O
then O
we O
sat O
down O
to O
begin O
ordering O
appetizers O
. O

Judging O
from O
previous O
posts O
this O
used O
to O
be O
a O
good O
place O
, O
but O
not O
any O
longer O
. O

All O
the O
staff O
is O
absolutely O
professional O
! O
! O

Our O
teenage O
kids O
love O
it O
, O
too O
. O

What O
a O
tastly O
, O
flaky O
treat O
! O

Worst O
Service O
I O
Ever O
Had O

The O
pizza O
is O
delicious O
and O
the O
proprietor O
is O
one O
of O
the O
nicest O
in O
NYC O
. O

Yes O
, O
the O
place O
is O
classy O
and O
beautiful O
, O
but O
they O
most O
certainly O
target O
the O
uber O
whealthy O
Not O
the O
common O
joe O
that O
wants O
to O
go O
all O
out O
every O
once O
in O
a O
while O
. O

Despite O
a O
slightly O
limited O
menu O
, O
everything O
prepared O
is O
done O
to O
perfection O
, O
ultra O
fresh O
and O
a O
work O
of O
food O
art O
. O

Service O
is O
not O
exactly O
five O
star O
, O
but O
thats O
not O
really O
a O
big O
deal O
. O

The O
freshest O
, O
best O
variety O
, O
and O
the O
fastest O
delivery O
. O

It O
is O
quite O
a O
spectacular O
scene O
i'll O
give O
them O
that O
. O

Avoid O
this O
place O
! O

By O
far O
, O
the O
best O
pizza O
in O
Manhattan O
. O

Best O
of O
all O
is O
the O
warm O
vibe O
, O
the O
owner O
is O
super O
friendly O
and O
service O
is O
fast O
. O

The O
staff O
are O
friendly O
and O
the O
decor O
was O
ethic O
and O
colorful O
. O

Probably O
would O
not O
go O
again O
... O

Arigato O

The O
music O
is O
great O
, O
no O
night O
better O
or O
worse O
, O
the O
bar O
tenders O
are O
generous O
with O
the O
pouring O
, O
and O
the O
lighthearted O
atmosphere O
will O
lifts O
you O
spirits O
. O

What's O
the O
difference O
between O
the O
two O
? O

– O
I O
decided O
to O
eat O
at O
Stack O
because O
of O
their O
price O
fixed O
pre-show O
dinner O
. O

It's O
all O
about O
the O
food O
! O
! O

this O
is O
can O
became O
on O
e O
of O
the O
NY O
Italian O
Food O
fare O
institutions O
. O

– O
first O
of O
all O
henrymillionare O
you O
dont O
know O
a O
thing O
about O
middle O
eastern O
food O
so O
dont O
talk O
. O

The O
place O
is O
small O
and O
intimate O
and O
you O
may O
feel O
a O
little O
crowded O
, O
but O
the O
service O
is O
excellent O
and O
it's O
great O
for O
friends O
out O
, O
a O
romantic O
date O
, O
or O
a O
special O
occassion O
. O

The O
place O
is O
beautiful O
! O

Only O
complaint O
is O
the O
pricing--I O
believe O
it O
would O
be O
more O
reasonable O
to O
pay O
a O
dollar O
less O
on O
each O
item O
listed O
on O
the O
menu O
. O

One O
of O
the O
BEST O

We O
were O
very O
pleasantly O
surprised O
. O

Love O
YUKA O
. O

Thanks O
Bloom's O
for O
a O
lovely O
trip O
. O

Don't O
miss O
Bloom's O
on O
your O
next O
trip O
to O
Manhatten O
. O

the O
ambiance O
of O
the O
restaurant O
was O
nice O
and O
good O
for O
fine O
dinning O
. O

Luckily O
we O
saved O
room O
for O
the O
BBQ O
Salmon O
, O
Sea O
Bass O
and O
Crispy O
Duck O
. O

The O
martinis O
are O
amazing O
and O
very O
fairly O
priced O
. O

I O
just O
found O
out O
that O
you O
can O
have O
the O
place O
to O
yourself O
on O
nights O
and O
weekends O
for O
a O
private O
party O
- O
can't O
wait O
to O
celebrate O
my O
next O
birthday O
there O
. O

They O
have O
great O
rolls O
, O
the O
triple O
color O
and O
norwegetan O
rolls O
, O
are O
awesome O
and O
filling O
. O

Wait O
staff O
is O
blantently O
unappreciative O
of O
your O
business O
but O
its O
the O
best O
pie O
on O
the O
UWS O
! O

The O
lava O
cake O
dessert O
was O
incredible O
and O
I O
recommend O
it O
. O

That O
place O
was O
awesome O
, O
, O
, O
sally O
! O

In O
the O
past O
sake O
usuallly O
just O
tasted O
kind O
of O
like O
salty O
water O
to O
me O
. O

and O
the O
waiter O
suggested O
a O
perfect O
sake O
! O
! O

We O
visited O
Orsay O
during O
NY O
Restaurant O
Week O
and O
tried O
their O
$ O
35 O
menu O
. O

On O
a O
recent O
trip O
, O
our O
waiter O
was O
extremely O
dismissive O
, O
while O
no O
less O
than O
three O
staff O
members O
waited O
hand-and-foot O
on O
a O
pair O
of O
Japanese O
girls O
seated O
nearby O
. O

Every O
time O
in O
New O
York O
I O
make O
it O
a O
point O
to O
visit O
Restaurant O
Saul O
on O
Smith O
Street O
. O

I O
never O
used O
to O
be O
a O
fan O
of O
sakes O
but O
am O
lately O
experimenting O
with O
it O
a O
lot O
more O
and O
am O
acquiring O
a O
better O
taste O
of O
it O
. O

Highly O
impressed O
from O
the O
decor O
to O
the O
food O
to O
the O
hospitality O
to O
the O
great O
night O
I O
had O
! O

I O
have O
been O
here O
, O
spent O
tons O
of O
money O
on O
a O
chef O
special O
dinner O
and O
it O
was O
a O
major O
dissappointment O
. O

The O
service O
is O
excellent O
, O
the O
decor O
is O
great O
, O
and O
the O
food O
is O
delicious O
and O
comes O
in O
large O
portions O
. O

I O
asked O
for O
an O
open O
faced O
cheese O
sandwich O
and O
the O
manager O
basically O
told O
me O
to O
take O
my O
business O
elsewhere O
! O

But O
if O
you're O
prepared O
to O
spend O
some O
$ O
and O
remember O
to O
ask O
if O
something O
they O
offer O
is O
complimentary O
, O
then O
this O
is O
the O
place O
to O
go O
for O
Indian O
food O

With O
the O
great O
variety O
on O
the O
menu O
, O
I O
eat O
here O
often O
and O
never O
get O
bored O
. O

Great O
seasonal O
fish O
and O
seafood O
, O
with O
a O
classy O
waterfront O
setting O
. O

Great O
find O
in O
the O
West O
Village O
! O

I've O
been O
wanting O
to O
go O
to O
this O
place O
forever O
and O
finally O
got O
a O
table O
. O

We O
were O
offered O
water O
for O
the O
table O
but O
were O
not O
told O
the O
Voss O
bottles O
of O
water O
were O
$ O
8 O
a O
piece O
. O

The O
potato O
balls O
were O
not O
dry O
at O
all O
... O
in O
fact O
it O
was O
buttery O
. O

– O
After O
12 O
years O
in O
Seattle O
Ray's O
rates O
as O
the O
place O
we O
always O
go O
back O
to O
. O

I O
did O
not O
try O
the O
caviar O
but O
I O
tried O
their O
salmon O
and O
crab O
salad O
( O
they O
are O
all O
good O
) O

As O
many O
other O
reviewers O
noticed O
, O
your O
order O
is O
often O
slow O
to O
arrive O
- O
this O
is O
particularly O
true O
in O
the O
evening O
but O
is O
not O
a O
problem O
during O
lunch O
time O
. O

A O
brief O
conversation O
with O
the O
manager O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
meal O
was O
the O
greatest O
disappointment--to O
say O
we O
had O
been O
" O
blown O
off O
" O
would O
be O
an O
understatement O
. O

Sushi O
experience O
was O
unbelievable O
with O
my O
fiance O
. O

The O
dessert O
( O
we O
had O
a O
pear O
torte O
) O
was O
good O
- O
but O
, O
once O
again O
, O
the O
staff O
was O
unable O
to O
provide O
appropriate O
drink O
suggestions O
. O

It O
was O
served O
with O
skin O
, O
over O
a O
bed O
of O
extremely O
undercooked O
spinach O
and O
mashed O
potatoes O
. O

Always O
a O
winner O
. O

Suan O
is O
a O
great O
place O
that O
I O
often O
take O
my O
friends O
( O
classmates O
) O
too O
. O

Compared O
to O
other O
shabu O
restaurants O
around O
town O
, O
this O
places O
wins O
hands-down O
. O

Although O
the O
service O
could O
be O
improved O
considering O
the O
money O
you O
put O
in O
. O

Service O
was O
just O
ok O
, O
it O
is O
not O
what O
you'd O
expect O
for O
$ O
500 O
. O

They O
refuse O
to O
seat O
parties O
of O
3 O
or O
more O
on O
weekends O
. O

for O
desert O
we O
had O
the O
mango O
ginger O
creme O
brulee O
... O
oh O
la O
la O
yummy O
! O
! O
! O

This O
place O
has O
totally O
weird O
decor O
, O
stairs O
going O
up O
with O
mirrored O
walls O
- O
I O
am O
surprised O
how O
no O
one O
yet O
broke O
their O
head O
or O
fall O
off O
the O
stairs O
- O
mirrored O
walls O
make O
you O
dizzy O
and O
delusional O
... O

I O
recently O
went O
to O
this O
restaurant O
with O
some O
co-workers O
for O
lunch O
and O
had O
an O
amazing O
time O
. O

Regardless O
, O
we'll O
be O
back O
and O
can't O
wait O
to O
visit O
in O
the O
summer O
to O
take O
advantage O
of O
the O
patio O
. O

Service O
was O
slow O
, O
but O
the O
people O
were O
friendly O
. O

The O
prices O
are O
outrageous O
, O
especially O
since O
the O
food O
was O
actually O
less O
satisfying O
than O
most O
neighborhood O
Chinese O
establishments O
. O

My O
friends O
and O
I O
were O
on O
vacation O
in O
NY O
and O
was O
referred O
to O
Chance O
by O
a O
friend O
. O

At O
best O
, O
the O
food O
was O
good O
and O
definately O
overpriced O
. O

Not O
what O
I O
would O
expect O
for O
the O
price O
and O
prestige O
of O
this O
location O
. O

But O
the O
service O
is O
HORRID O
! O

However O
, O
the O
value O
and O
service O
are O
both O
severely O
lacking O
. O

The O
tables O
are O
crammed O
way O
too O
close O
, O
the O
menu O
is O
typical O
of O
any O
Italian O
restaurant O
, O
and O
the O
wine O
list O
is O
simply O
overpriced O
. O

i O
love O
this O
place O
! O

The O
appetizers O
we O
ordered O
were O
served O
quickly O
- O
an O
order O
of O
fried O
oysters O
and O
clams O
were O
delicious O
but O
a O
tiny O
portion O
( O
maybe O
3 O
of O
each O
) O
. O

Price O
and O
quality O
of O
fish O
alone O
will O
keep O
us O
from O
making O
a O
return O
visit O
. O

I O
can't O
wait O
for O
summer O
, O
when O
they O
serve O
outside O
on O
their O
gigantic O
patio O
. O

You O
can O
do O
it O
here O
. O

My O
boyfriend O
and O
I O
went O
there O
to O
celebrate O
my O
birthday O
the O
other O
night O
and O
all O
I O
can O
say O
is O
that O
it O
was O
magnificent O
. O

It O
wasn't O
as O
if O
this O
restaurant O
had O
any O
major O
bragging O
points O
before O
hand O
, O
but O
now O
it's O
simply O
repulsive O
. O

Too O
bad O
the O
food O
wasn't O
of O
the O
same O
heritage O
. O

And O
it O
all O
comes O
at O
a O
very O
reasonable O
price O
( O
congee O
, O
noodles O
, O
and O
rice O
dishes O
are O
no O
more O
than O
$ O
3-6 O
each O
) O
. O

Addicting O
! O

would O
NOT O
go O
back O
. O

supercilious O
scorn O
is O
in O
. O

I've O
been O
here O
twice O
now O
. O

Small O
servings O
for O
main O
entree O
, O
i O
had O
salmon O
( O
wasnt O
impressed O
) O
girlfriend O
had O
chicken O
, O
it O
was O
good O
. O

Just O
ignore O
the O
trendy O
wannabes O
. O

great O
service O

So O
rushing O
us O
out O
was O
absolutely O
unnecessary O
! O

With O
so O
many O
good O
restaurants O
on O
the O
UWS O
, O
I O
don't O
need O
overpriced O
food O
, O
absurdly O
arrogant O
wait-staff O
who O
don't O
recognize O
they O
work O
at O
a O
glorified O
diner O
, O
clumsy O
service O
, O
and O
management O
that O
doesn't O
care O
. O

One O
of O
the O
best O
Sushi O
place O
in O
town O
. O

The O
9 O
oz O
steak O
came O
next O
and O
it O
tasted O
great O
, O
at O
least O
initially O
. O

The O
owners O
are O
great O
fun O
and O
the O
beer O
selection O
is O
worth O
staying O
for O
. O

What O
? O

– O
I O
highly O
recommend O
Mioposto O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
Caviar O
Russe O
to O
anyone O
who O
wants O
delicious O
top O
grade O
caviar O
and O
fantastic O
service O
. O

Ingredients O
are O
organic O
which O
is O
a O
real O
plus O
for O
me O
. O

Went O
there O
for O
an O
office O
lunch O
. O

Have O
been O
dozens O
of O
times O
and O
never O
failed O
to O
enjoy O
the O
experience O
. O

This O
is O
a O
nice O
pizza O
place O
with O
good O
selection O
of O
thin O
crust O
pizza O
including O
the O
Basil O
slice O
. O

He O
offers O
subpar O
service O
and O
has O
no O
personality O
. O

Food O
- O
awesome O
. O

The O
wine O
list O
is O
incredible O
and O
extensive O
and O
diverse O
, O
the O
food O
is O
all O
incredible O
and O
the O
staff O
was O
all O
very O
nice O
, O
good O
at O
their O
jobs O
and O
cultured O
. O

I O
have O
eaten O
here O
three O
times O
and O
have O
found O
the O
quality O
and O
variety O
of O
the O
fish O
to O
be O
excellent O
. O

We O
did O
have O
the O
same O
waiter O
the O
second O
time O
, O
so O
maybe O
the O
service O
is O
spotty O
and O
our O
luck O
is O
good O
. O

And O
the O
upstairs O
is O
a O
great O
place O
to O
hang O
out O
. O

Over O
the O
years O
the O
host O
, O
Vittorio O
, O
and O
his O
crew O
, O
have O
always O
treated O
me O
as O
family--although O
with O
all O
the O
business O
this O
not-so-little O
gem O
does O
, O
it O
amazing O
he's O
even O
able O
to O
remember O
a O
consistent O
but O
not-so-frequent O
visitor O
. O

Mizu O
is O
home O
to O
creative O
and O
unique O
rolls O
not O
to O
found O
anywhere O
else O
. O

I O
love O
Ess-a-bagel O
, O
but O
I O
live O
on O
the O
west O
side O
, O
so O
I O
often O
go O
to O
Murray's O
for O
convenience O
. O

Cut O
to O
the O
chase O
- O
this O
is O
amazing O
! O

Oh O
yeah O
... O
the O
view O
was O
good O
, O
too O
. O

It O
was O
wonderful O
. O

The O
baked O
clams O
octopus O
we O
shared O
as O
appetizers O
were O
the O
best O
we've O
ever O
had O
! O
! O

I O
pray O
it O
stays O
open O
forever O
. O

The O
portion O
sizes O
here O
are O
huge O
, O
and O
the O
sushi O
is O
good O
. O

Good O
spreads O
, O
great O
beverage O
selections O
and O
bagels O
really O
tasty O
. O

A O
Thai O
restaurant O
out O
of O
rice O
during O
dinner O
? O

Melt O
in O
your O
mouth O
nigiri O
and O
sashmi O
, O
and O
very O
tasty O
rolls O
too O
. O

i O
would O
recommend O
reservations O
on O
weekends O
though O
. O

Worth O
the O
trip O
from O
Manhattan O
. O

So O
eat O
fast O
and O
order O
a O
lot O
. O

Sauce O
was O
watery O
and O
the O
food O
didn't O
have O
much O
flavor O
. O

More O
Williamsburg O
Garbage O

I O
am O
so O
happy O
to O
have O
a O
wonderful O
Italian O
restaurant O
in O
my O
neighborhood O
. O

This O
place O
would O
be O
so O
much O
better O
served O
by O
being O
run O
by O
a O
group O
that O
actually O
understands O
customer O
service O
. O

I O
thought O
going O
to O
Jimmys O
would O
give O
me O
a O
real O
Domincan O
exprience O
. O

The O
food O
is O
all O
shared O
so O
we O
get O
to O
order O
together O
and O
eat O
together O
. O

I've O
also O
been O
amazed O
at O
all O
the O
new O
additions O
in O
the O
past O
few O
years O
: O
A O
new O
Jazz O
Bar O
, O
the O
most O
fantastic O
Dining O
Garden O
, O
the O
Best O
Thin O
Crust O
Pizzas O
, O
and O
now O
a O
Lasagna O
Menu O
which O
is O
to O
die O
for O
( O
these O
are O
not O
your O
average O
lasagnas O
) O
! O

– O
This O
past O
weekend O
had O
great O
weather O
for O
San O
Francisco O
standards O
. O

We O
went O
around O
9:30 O
on O
a O
Friday O
and O
it O
had O
died O
down O
a O
bit O
by O
then O
so O
the O
service O
was O
great O
! O

Cool O
atmosphere O
, O
the O
fire O
place O
in O
the O
back O
really O
ads O
to O
it O
but O
needs O
a O
bit O
more O
heat O
throughout O
on O
a O
cold O
night O
. O

The O
food O
was O
very O
good O
, O
a O
great O
deal O
, O
and O
the O
place O
its O
self O
was O
great O
. O

those O
rolls O
were O
big O
, O
but O
not O
good O
and O
sashimi O
wasn't O
fresh O
. O

Love O
it O
. O

We O
were O
ushered O
to O
the O
bar O
to O
wait O
momentarily O
and O
upon O
arrival O
were O
so O
excited O
. O

The O
best O
Chuwam O
Mushi O
I O
have O
ever O
had O
. O

Much O
more O
than O
just O
a O
great O
view O
! O

We O
had O
a O
very O
hard O
time O
getting O
the O
waitress O
' O
attention O
and O
finally O
had O
to O
get O
up O
and O
go O
inside O
to O
speak O
to O
a O
manager O
. O

I O
was O
pleasantly O
suprised O
. O

Inexpensive O
, O
unassuming O
, O
great O
time O
! O

highly O
recommended O
. O

The O
restaurant O
is O
a O
bit O
noisy O
but O
that O
is O
something O
that O
can O
be O
overlooked O
once O
you O
sit O
down O
and O
enjoy O
a O
great O
meal O

Holy O
Hummus O
! O

The O
first O
time O
I O
went O
, O
and O
was O
completely O
taken O
by O
the O
live O
jazz O
band O
and O
atmosphere O
, O
I O
ordered O
the O
Lobster O
Cobb O
Salad O
. O

The O
view O
is O
spectacular O
, O
and O
the O
food O
is O
great O
. O

I O
had O
the O
beef O
kabobs O
with O
a O
side O
of O
cucumber O
yogurt O
. O

I O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
to O
find O
this O
gem O
in O
Hoboken O
. O

I O
had O
never O
had O
Edamame O
pureed O
before O
but O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
innovative O
and O
tasty O
( O
could've O
used O
a O
bit O
more O
salt O
) O
. O

The O
lobster O
sandwich O
is O
$ O
24 O
and O
although O
it O
was O
good O
it O
was O
not O
nearly O
enough O
to O
warrant O
that O
price O
. O

Check O
out O
the O
secret O
back O
room O
. O

The O
waiter O
was O
attentive O
. O

I O
choose O
to O
go O
with O
one O
of O
the O
special O
, O
the O
braised O
lamb O
shank O
in O
red O
wine O
, O
which O
was O
excellent O
. O

The O
staff O
is O
no O
nonsense O
. O

Bukhara O
is O
on O
my O
top O
5 O
Indian O
places O
in O
NYC O

Surprised O
that O
a O
place O
of O
this O
caliber O
would O
advertise O
it O
as O
Kobe O
. O

The O
pizza O
’ O
s O
are O
thin O
crust O
and O
the O
menu O
offers O
very O
creative O
combinations O
and O
toppings O
. O

The O
only O
problem O
would O
be O
the O
wait O
, O
but O
we O
usually O
just O
have O
a O
drink O
in O
the O
front O
while O
waiting O
. O

I'm O
not O
picky O
- O
but O
it O
was O
actually O
gross O
. O

This O
place O
is O
always O
packed O
. O

We O
ordered O
dosut O
bibimbap O
and O
nakgi-bokum O
. O

I O
am O
not O
the O
most O
experienced O
person O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
Thai O
food O
, O
but O
my O
friend O
who O
took O
me O
there O
is O
. O

I've O
had O
better O
chicken O
at O
BBQs O
! O
! O
! O

and O
you O
can't O
beat O
the O
prices O
. O

The O
food O
was O
well O
prepared O
and O
the O
service O
impecable O
. O

The O
service O
was O
exceptional O
- O
sometime O
there O
was O
a O
feeling O
that O
we O
were O
served O
by O
the O
army O
of O
friendly O
waiters O
. O

Yamato O

an O
excellent O
place O
to O
go O

youre O
not O
into O

or O
if O
you O
have O
friends O
who O
doesnt O
like O

much O

I O

Over O
all O
the O
looks O
of O
the O

exceeds O
the O
actual O
meals O

Mistakes O
happen O
, O
but O
they O
are O
usually O
accompanied O
by O
an O
apology O
, O
perhaps O
even O
a O
glass O
of O

but O
not O
the O

I O
love O
this O
restaurant O

We O
went O
here O
for O
lunch O
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O
ago O
on O
a O
Saturday O
, O
and O
I O
was O
thoroughly O
impressed O
with O
the O
food O
. O

I O
went O
here O
with O
my O
boyfriend O
for O
our O
anniversary O
. O

But O
the O
servers O
were O
extremely O
attentive O
and O
very O
friendly O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
servers O
are O
very O
attentive O
, O
friendly O
and O
quite O
attractive O
. O

Creative O
, O
consistent O
, O
fresh O
. O

The O
food O
was O
lousy O
- O
too O
sweet O
or O
too O
salty O
and O
the O
portions O
tiny O
. O

The O
waitress O
came O
to O
check O
in O
on O
us O
every O
few O
minutes O
, O
and O
began O
to O
clear O
the O
plates O
while O
half O
of O
us O
were O
still O
eating O
( O
a O
big O
pet O
peeve O
of O
mine O
that O
happens O
almost O
everywhere O
, O
so O
I O
try O
to O
ignore O
it O
) O
. O

Service O
was O
devine O
, O
oysters O
where O
a O
sensual O
as O
they O
come O
, O
and O
the O
price O
can't O
be O
beat O
! O
! O
! O

No O
, O
really O
. O

The O
meat O
is O
fresh O
, O
the O
sauces O
are O
great O
, O
you O
get O
kimchi O
and O
a O
salad O
free O
with O
your O
meal O
and O
service O
is O
good O
too O
. O

Super O
YUMMY O

Great O

We O
were O
10 O
people O

a O
birthday O

we O
sat O
in O

tent O
. O

I O
will O
have O
to O
do O
more O
research O
before O
checking O
out O
new O
places O
based O
on O
Diners O
, O
drive-ins O
and O
dives O
reviews O
. O

You O
can't O
go O
wrong O
here O
. O

I've O
always O
found O
the O
wait O
staff O
and O
, O
if O
you O
sit O
at O
the O
bar O
, O
the O
cooks O
very O
friendly O
. O

Never O
too O
crowded O
and O
always O
great O
service O
. O

It O
is O
definitely O
a O
good O
spot O
for O
snacks O
and O
chat O
. O

After O
passing O
by O
this O
restaurant O
for O
sometime O
I O
finally O
decided O
to O
go O
in O
and O
have O
dinner O
. O

– O
I O
took O
my O
parents O
here O
for O
their O
anniversary-very O
very O
disappointed O
! O
! O
! O

Their O
apps O
are O
all O
delicious O
. O

Not O
alot O
of O
smoking O
places O
left O
in O
New O
York O
, O
but O
I O
have O
found O
my O
favorite O
smoking O
balconey O
in O
the O
city O
. O

it O
was O
really O
good O
pizza O
. O

The O
fish O
was O
not O
fresh O
and O
the O
rice O
tasted O
old O
and O
stale O
. O

Food O
was O
just O
average O
... O
if O
they O
lowered O
the O
prices O
just O
a O
bit O
, O
it O
would O
be O
a O
bigger O
draw O
. O

First O
of O
all O
Dal O
Bukhara O
Rocks O
. O

– O
i O
have O
been O
eating O
at O
this O
place O
for O
over O
8 O
years O
now O
and O
i O
have O
never O
had O
one O
bad O
meal O
. O

Great O
wine O
selection O
, O
Gigondas O
is O
worth O
the O
price O
, O
and O
the O
house O
champagne O
is O
a O
great O
value O
. O

Insultingly O
Overpriced O

For O
the O
price O
, O
you O
cannot O
eat O
this O
well O
in O
Manhattan O
. O

Salads O
were O
fantastic O
. O

The O
wait O
staff O
is O
very O
courteous O
and O
accomodating O
. O

– O
We O
dined O
at O
the O
Colorado O
location O
today O
. O

– O
I've O
been O
to O
Open O
Sesame O
only O
once O
, O
but O
I'm O
still O
reeling O
from O
the O
experience O
! O
! O

The O
food O
here O
is O
rather O
good O
, O
but O
only O
if O
you O
like O
to O
wait O
for O
it O
. O

Why O
? O

I'd O
highly O
recommend O
it O
for O
a O
special O
occasion O
- O
- O
it O
provides O
and O
intimate O
setting O
and O
nice O
service O
. O

Warm O
and O
friendly O
in O
the O
winter O
and O
terrific O
outdoor O
seating O
in O
the O
warmer O
months O
. O

Good O
Sushi O
, O
High O
Price O

We O
love O
the O
food O
, O
drinks O
, O
and O
atmosphere O
! O

The O
crust O
has O
a O
great O
bite O
and O
a O
good O
chew O
, O
the O
sauce O
is O
light O
with O
a O
nice O
acidity O
to O
it O
, O
the O
salt O
from O
the O
cheese O
is O
great O
, O
really O
heightens O
the O
flavor O
of O
all O
the O
other O
components O
. O

Went O
here O
on O
sat O
1/26 O
and O
was O
disappointed O
. O

As O
part O
of O
a O
small O
party O
of O
four O
, O
our O
food O
was O
dropped O
off O
without O
comment O
; O

The O
food O
can O
get O
pricey O
but O
the O
prixe O
fixe O
tasting O
menu O
is O
the O
greatest O
food O
for O
a O
good O
price O
and O
they O
cater O
the O
food O
to O
any O
food O
allergies O
or O
food O
you O
don't O
like O
. O

I O
have O
never O
had O
cheescake O
like O
this O
. O

Yes O
, O
the O
prices O
are O
high O
, O
but O
I O
felt O
it O
was O
worth O
it O
. O

LLOOVVE O
THIS O
PLACE O
. O

After O
all O
that O
, O
they O
complained O
to O
me O
about O
the O
small O
tip O
. O

Its O
dark O
, O
and O
cozy O
.. O
there O
is O
always O
jazz O
music O
playing O
when O
we O
go O
. O

The O
food O
was O
bland O
oily O
. O

Fine O
, O
I O
wont O
hang O
you O
for O
that O
. O

I O
will O
not O
go O
back O
. O

Also O
have O
great O
margaritas O
! O

Your O
friends O
will O
thank O
you O
for O
introducing O
them O
to O
this O
gem O
! O

Also O
, O
they O
serve O
THE O
best O
hummus O
in O
America O
, O
with O
a O
drizzle O
of O
fragrant O
olive O
oil O
( O
which O
, O
I O
believe O
is O
the O
traditional O
way O
) O
! O

It O
is O
not O
worth O
going O
at O
all O
and O
spend O
your O
money O
there O
! O
! O
! O

No O
gimmicks O
here O
- O
- O
the O
food O
speaks O
for O
itself O
in O
its O
freshness O
and O
preparation O
. O

He O
served O
me O
an O
Uni O
Hand O
roll O
, O
which O
I O
never O
had O
before O
, O
and O
let O
me O
tell O
you O
... O
IT O
WAS O
HEAVEN O
! O

The O
waiter O
delivered O
our O
food O
while O
holding O
what O
appeared O
to O
be O
a O
plastic O
bag O
of O
garbage O
in O
one O
hand O
. O

Terrible O
would O
be O
a O
compliment O
! O

None O
that O
I O
can O
think O
of O
. O

We O
ordered O
some O
beef O
and O
noodle O
soup O
dishes O
from O
the O
Thai O
section O
of O
the O
menu O
but O
nothing O
we O
got O
was O
Thai O
. O

MMmmm O
... O
it O
was O
delicious O
. O

I O
liked O
it O
. O

The O
food O
is O
good O
, O
especially O
their O
more O
basic O
dishes O
, O
and O
the O
drinks O
are O
delicious O
. O

This O
place O
was O
reccomended O
to O
me O
by O
a O
friend O
. O

I O
hope O
one O
day O
Scooner O
or O
Later O
returns O
to O
what O
it O
once O
was O
. O

If O
it O
seemed O
possible O
to O
do O
so O
while O
there O
I O
would O
have O
fought O
my O
bill O
since O
my O
dinner O
portion O
of O
my O
meal O
was O
inedible O
! O

Mediocre O

I O
noice O
most O
reviews O
mention O
the O
bad O
service O
. O

There O
are O
many O
Thai O
places O
in O
the O
city O
but O
so O
far O
Toons O
is O
# O
1 O
. O

It's O
fresh O
, O
welcoming O
, O
delicious O
, O
and O
relaxing O
. O

I O
come O
here O
enjoy O
very O
much O
with O
husband O

The O
worst O
excuse O
for O
Japanese O
food O
I've O
ever O
encountered O
. O

One O
of O
my O
favorite O
places O
in O
Brooklyn O
. O

Stay O
away O

short O
and O
sweet O
– O
seating O
is O
great O
: O
it's O
romantic O
, O
cozy O
and O
private O
. O

You O
won O
’ O
t O
be O
disappointed O
by O
their O
menu O
. O

Went O
for O
Mom's O
birthday O
brunch O
/ O
lunch O
. O

None O
was O
made O
so O
i O
hung O
up O
. O

The O
staff O
is O
pretty O
friendly O
. O

They're O
rude O
at O
times O
, O
and O
not O
very O
friendly O
. O

I O
thought O
the O
restaurant O
was O
nice O
and O
clean O
. O

but O
ive O
heard O
a O
lot O
about O
this O
for O
the O
past O
2 O
yrs O
and O
finally O
decided O
to O
eat O
here O
. O

1 O
o'clock O
in O
the O
morning O
. O

Definately O
check O
it O
out O
! O
! O
! O

Even O
then O
, O
the O
order O
was O
not O
correct O
and O
we O
were O
still O
waiting O
for O
a O
couple O
items O
. O

The O
specialty O
here O
is O
decadent O
pancakes O
, O
but O
I've O
been O
back O
now O
four O
times O
, O
and O
I've O
been O
wowed O
every O
time O
. O

One O
of O
my O
favorite O
places O
in O
Manhattan O
. O

Aside O
from O
the O
Sea O
Urchin O
, O
the O
chef O
recommended O
an O
assortment O
of O
fish O
including O
Fatty O
Yellow O
Tail O
, O
Boton O
Shrimp O
, O
Blue O
Fin O
Torro O
( O
Fatty O
Tuna O
) O
, O
Sea O

etc O
. O

Green O
tea O
creme O
brulee O
gets O
better O
each O
time O
I O
have O
it O
. O

I O
like O
the O
somosas O
, O
chai O
, O
and O
the O
chole O
, O
but O
the O
dhosas O
and O
dhal O
were O
kinda O
dissapointing O
. O

Service O
- O
friendly O
and O
attentive O
. O

When O
the O
bill O
came O
, O
nothing O
was O
comped O
, O
so O
I O
told O
the O
manager O
very O
politely O
that O
we O
were O
willing O
to O
pay O
for O
the O
wine O
, O
but O
I O
didn't O
think O
I O
should O
have O
to O
pay O
for O
food O
with O
a O
maggot O
in O
it O
. O

amazing O
fresh O
dogs O
but O
best O
of O
all O
endless O
toppings O
! O
! O
! O

We O
will O
return O
many O
times O
for O
this O
oasis O
in O
mid-town O
. O

This O
place O
has O
great O
indian O
chinese O
food O
. O

And O
evaluated O
on O
those O
terms O
Pastis O
is O
simply O
wonderful O
. O

Great O
food O
, O
good O
size O
menu O
, O
great O
service O
and O
an O
unpretensious O
setting O
. O

Fantastic O
! O

Too O
bad O
Latin O
Quarters O
closed O

Obviously O
the O
Chinese O
translation O
of O
this O
place O
does O
not O
mean O
Big O
Wong O
, O
it O
actually O
means O
Great O

I O
HAVE O
NEVER O
EVER O
HAD O
SUCH O
AN O
UNPLEASANT O
EXPERIENCE O
. O

I O
FOUND O
A O
NEW O
HOME O
ON O
SECOND O

! O
! O
! O

The O
food O
here O
was O
mediocre O
at O
best O
. O

HIGHLY O
RECOMMENDED O
! O
! O
! O

Best O
restaurant O
in O
Brooklyn O

Love O
it O
every O
time O

They O
don't O
concern O
much O
of O
customer's O
health O
, O
just O
want O
to O
make O
money O
. O

Great O
staff O
. O

Won't O
or O
Can't O
is O
not O
in O
the O
service O
directory O
. O

I O
absolutely O
Loved O
this O
place O
. O

The O
best O
dish O
are O
the O
honwy O
walnut O
prawns O
- O
just O
outstanding O
. O

Great O
food O
. O

You O
can O
get O
a O
table O
without O
a O
reservation O
if O
you O
get O
there O
early O
I O
they O
don't O
make O
you O
by O
bottles O
. O

They O
tell O
me O
they O
are O
going O
to O
cover O
the O
garden O
in O
glass O
for O
the O
winter O
, O
so O
i'm O
looking O
forward O
to O
going O
there O
on O
a O
snowy O
night O
to O
enjoy O
it O
. O

Small O
, O
bright O
, O
and O
clean O
, O
BZ O
Grill O
stands O
apart O
from O
the O
usual O
run O
of O
gyro O
joints O
, O
both O
in O
Astoria O
and O
out O
. O

– O
Where O
can O
I O
begin O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
the O
Sophia O
pizza O
. O

We O
both O
opted O
for O
a O
pasta O
dish O
and O
they O
were O
served O
timely O
and O
fresh O
. O

Have O
the O
iced O
tea O
. O

It O
is O
so O
romantic O
. O

Normally O
, O
places O
ask O
how O
hot O
you O
want O
it O
, O
but O
they O
didn't O
. O

The O
dishes O
came O
out O
around O
5 O
minutes O
apart O
. O

This O
place O
is O
not O
worth O
the O
prices O
. O

The O
decor O
is O
vibrant O
and O
eye-pleasing O
with O
several O
semi-private O
boths O
on O
the O
right O
side O
of O
the O
dining O
hall O
, O
which O
are O
great O
for O
a O
date O
. O

Lebanese O

it O
is O
sad O
there O
is O
not O
many O
people O
who O
frequent O
eating O
at O
places O
like O
these O
that O
look O
pricey O
because O
they O
are O
at O
the O
hotel O
... O
but O
they O
are O
definitely O
one O
you O
dont O
want O
to O
miss O
, O
esp O
if O
your O
in O
downtown O
san O
jose O
. O

Way O
below O
average O

I O
definitely O
wouldn't O
go O
back O
. O

If O
you O
like O
spicy O
food O
get O
the O
chicken O
vindaloo O
. O

I'm O
sure O
I'll O
return O
for O
a O
final O
judgement O
tho O
. O

I O
had O
the O
Lamb O
special O
which O
was O
perfect O
. O

I O
started O
out O
with O
a O
Bombay O
beer O
which O
was O
big O
enough O
for O
two O
. O

The O
food O
was O
great O
and O
tasty O
, O
but O
the O
sitting O
space O
was O
too O
small O
, O
I O
don't O
like O
being O
cramp O
in O
a O
corner O
. O

Better O
than O
the O
bagel O
shop O
on O
the O
corner O
, O
but O
not O
worth O
going O
out O
of O
your O
way O
for O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
. O

I O
love O
it O
. O

Go O
Beyond O
the O
California O
Rolls O

Stepping O
into O
Casa O
La O
Femme O
last O
night O
was O
a O
true O
experience O
unlike O
any O
other O
in O
New O
York O
! O

Chintzy O
portions O

Great O
food O
, O
spectacular O
location O
, O
and O
friendly O
service O
keep O
us O
coming O
back O
year O
after O
year O

Everything O

Food O
was O
OK O

Everything O
, O
and O
I O
mean O
everything O
on O
the O
menu O
is O
delectable O
. O

Great O
bagels O
made O
the O
old-fashioned O
way O
. O

Wonderful O
at O
holiday O
time O
. O

I O
do O
not O
recommend O
. O

There O
were O
3 O
bottles O
of O
perfume O
on O
the O
sink O
and O
the O
line O
of O
girls O
trying O
to O
use O
the O
sink O
. O

Don't O
dine O
at O
Tamarind O
for O
the O
vegetarian O
dishes O
, O
they O
are O
simply O
not O
up O
to O
par O
with O
the O
non-veg O
selections O
. O

I O
cannot O
imagine O
a O
friendlier O
staff O
working O
in O
a O
restaurant O
. O

you O
know O
what O
i O
mean O
all O
the O
positives O
things O
happening O
there O
made O
mw O
write O
this O
review O
. O

Love O
the O
enchiladas O
and O
chicken O
soup O
- O
and O
be O
sure O
to O
check O
out O
their O
specials O
. O

Always O
busy O
but O
fast O
moving O
. O

There O
was O
a O
small O
wait O
, O
but O
shorter O
than O
I O
expected O
. O

the O
all-u-can-eat O
sushi O
is O
definitely O
in O
very O
poor O
quality O
. O

Went O
there O
with O
my O
wife O
and O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
a O
table O
even O
though O
you O
could O
see O
there O
many O
that O
were O
empty O
with O
not O
reservation O
sigh O
on O
them O
. O

I O
also O
really O
enjoy O
the O
simplicity O
of O
the O
decor O
and O
intimate O
feeling O
of O
a O
small O
restaurant O
. O

I O
read O
reviews O
that O
called O
the O
restaurant O
too O
expensive O
and O
I O
thought O
to O
myself O
, O
but O
may O
be O
it O
is O
worth O
it O
. O

This O
place O
is O
so O
much O
fun O
. O

The O
space O
is O
limited O
so O
be O
prepared O
to O
wait O
up O
to O
45 O
minutes O
- O
1 O
hour O
, O
but O
be O
richly O
rewarded O
when O
you O
savor O
the O
delicious O
indo-chinese O
food O
. O

Will O
not O
be O
back O
. O

The O
waiter O
was O
attentive O
, O
the O
food O
was O
delicious O
and O
the O
views O
of O
the O
city O
were O
great O
. O

– O
First O
of O
all O
, O
I O
am O
not O
from O
Long O
Beach O
. O

Decor O
needs O
to O
be O
upgraded O
but O
the O
food O
is O
amazing O
! O

over O
. O

Loved O
it O

HOWEVER O
, O
one O
Sunday O
afternoon O
my O
husband O
and O
I O
did O
go O
( O
although O
with O
my O
loud O
protests O
) O
and O
were O
pleasantly O
surprised O
. O

you O
should O
travel O
from O
the O
Bronx O
to O
try O
it O
... O

Indo O
Chinese O
food O
, O
pretty O
good O
... O

We O
were O
drawn O
into O
the O
belly O
dancing O
show O
that O
captivated O
the O
crowd O
. O

The O
food O
is O
good O
. O

It's O
located O
in O
a O
strip O
mall O
near O
the O
Beverly O
Center O
, O
not O
the O
greatest O
location O
, O
but O
the O
food O
keeps O
me O
coming O
back O
for O
more O
. O

Try O
their O
chef's O
specials O
- O
- O
they O
are O
to O
die O
for O
. O

So O
I O
decide O
to O
report O
back O
to O
the O
waitress O
because O
it O
was O
completely O
inedible O
. O

The O
staff O
was O
really O
friendly O
. O

Our O
first O
time O
in O
New O
York O
and O
we O
had O
to O
try O
a O
New O
York O
Bagel O
. O

I O
LOOOVE O
their O
eggplant O
pizza O
, O
as O
well O
as O
their O
pastas O
! O

Also O
love O
their O
caeser O
salad O
. O

We O
asked O
for O
beverages O
and O
never O
received O
them O
. O

Not O
only O
can O
the O
selection O
be O
innovative O
, O
but O
there's O
a O
nice O
balance O
of O
traditional O
sushi O
as O
well O
. O

They O
were O
served O
warm O
and O
had O
a O
soft O
fluffy O
interior O
. O

First O
went O
here O
to O
enjoy O
their O
garden O
terrace O
. O

I O
tend O
to O
judge O
a O
sushi O
restaurant O
by O
its O
sea O
urchin O
, O
which O
was O
heavenly O
at O
sushi O
rose O
. O

We O
were O
walking O
around O
the O
village O
and O
went O
into O
this O
place O
just O
for O
some O
drinks O
. O

Wretched O
and O
retching O

The O
house O
special O
roll O
is O
really O
good O
. O

No O
plans O
to O
return O
anytime O
soon O
. O

Definitely O
a O
neighborhood O
favorite O
. O

Our O
drinks O
kept O
coming O
but O
our O
server O
came O
by O
a O
couple O
times O
. O

Chicken O
teriyaki O
had O
tomato O
or O
pimentos O
on O
top O
? O
? O

P O
. O
S O
. O
Please O
don't O
tell O
anyone O
in O
my O
family O
i O
eat O
there O
. O

melt O
in O
your O
mouth O
. O

Stuffing O
yourself O
with O
Japanese O
food O
is O
a O
rare O
thing O
. O

I've O
enjoyed O
99 O
% O
of O
the O
dishes O
we've O
ordered O
with O
the O
only O
exceptions O
being O
the O
occasional O
too-authentic-for-me O
dish O
( O
I'm O
a O
daring O
eater O
but O
not O
THAT O
daring O
) O
. O

Just O
go O
there O
and O
see O
for O
yourself O
. O

As O
BFC O
doesn't O
take O
reservations O
you O
almost O
always O
have O
to O
wait O
by O
the O
bar O
- O
and O
be O
abused O
by O
the O
front O
of O
house O
staff O
until O
you O
are O
seated O
, O
which O
can O
be O
over O
an O
hour O
later O
! O

I O
lived O
in O
Maine O
for O
ten O
years O
and O
grew O
up O
on O
fish O
. O

This O
is O
a O
nice O
restaurant O
if O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
good O
place O
to O
host O
an O
intimate O
dinner O
meeting O
with O
business O
associates O
. O

The O
food O
was O
good O
. O

– O
they O
have O
4 O
locations O
. O

One O
of O
the O
best O
hot O
dogs O
I O
have O
ever O
eaten O
. O

Delicious O

Everytime O
I O
decide O
to O
try O
another O
place O
on O
the O
UES O
, O
I O
get O
angry O
that O
I O
didn't O
just O
go O
to O
Zucchero O
Pomodori O
. O

My O
mom O
originally O
introduced O
me O
to O
this O
place O
, O
but O
even O
she O
( O
being O
Indian O
) O
feels O
the O
food O
can O
be O
somewhat O
over O
the O
top O
spicy O
and O
far O
too O
oily O
. O

They O
are O
not O
helpful O
in O
the O
least O
and O
will O
give O
you O
the O
grand O
run O
around O
so O
by O
the O
time O
the O
event O
date O
rolls O
around O
you O
will O
not O
only O
regret O
chosing O
this O
place O
, O
but O
also O
become O
hostile O
! O

Overall O
the O
restaurant O
is O
more O
expensive O
than O
our O
other O
sushi O
favorites O
, O
but O
everything O
was O
delicious O
. O

The O
food O
was O
authentic O
. O

I O
visit O
New O
Green O
Bo O
when O
I O
have O
money O
or O
when O
I O
am O
broke O
. O

A O
little O
overpriced O
but O
worth O
it O
once O
you O
take O
a O
bite O
. O

You O
are O
likely O
to O
be O
disappointed O
. O

If O
you O
’ O
re O
planning O
to O
come O
here O
, O
make O
sure O
that O
your O
date O
is O
someone O
whom O
you O
really O
like O
since O
you O
’ O
ll O
be O
ushered O
to O
private O
booths O
where O
there O
will O
be O
no O
people O
or O
food O
watching O
( O
choose O
the O
ones O
on O
the O
ground O
level O
that O
have O
glass O
ceilings O
so O
you O
may O
see O
the O
stars O
in O
the O
sky O
! O
) O
. O

The O
pizza O
was O
delivered O
cold O
and O
the O
cheese O
wasn't O
even O
fully O
melted O
! O

We've O
lived O
around O
the O
corner O
from O
this O
place O
for O
over O
a O
year O
and O
finally O
had O
dinner O
there O
. O

The O
bar O
is O
very O
well O
stocked O
with O
interesting O
beers O
and O
well O
priced O
wines O
. O

– O
I O
don't O
understand O
how O
I O
was O
a O
stranger O
to O
this O
place O
for O
so O
long O
... O
the O
fajita O
salad O
, O
the O
colorado O
, O
the O
fajitas O
- O
EVERYTHING O
is O
delicious O
. O

And O
they O
packaged O
everything O
nicely O
so O
it O
didn't O
spill O
. O

the O
bestt O
! O

Prices O
are O
in O
line O
. O

No O
Comparison O

I O
felt O
ackward O
and O
next O
time O
went O
to O
the O
casino O
bathroom O
. O

The O
dosas O
are O
skimpy O
, O
unattractive O
and O
drip O
with O
grease O
, O
and O
personally O
I'd O
drink O
popcorn O
topping O
before O
I'd O
eat O
another O
one O
of O
these O
. O

Everything O
we O
had O
was O
good O
or O
ok O
... O
but O
definitely O
nothing O
great O
. O

When O
we O
stumbled O
on O
Leon O
, O
we O
thought O
that O
we O
had O
found O
quite O
the O
gem O
BUT O
, O
we O
were O
certainly O
wrong O
. O

Still O
we O
keep O
going O
back O
:) O

The O
food O
is O
very O
good O
, O
but O
not O
outstanding O
. O

I've O
been O
there O
three O
times O
and O
have O
always O
had O
wonderful O
experiences O
. O

Great O
Hot O
Dogs O
! O

In O
an O
area O
sadly O
lacking O
in O
decent O
Thai O
food O
, O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
spots O
. O

Enjoyed O
the O
food O

absolutely O
fabulous O
! O
! O
! O

Mermaid O
Inn O
is O
an O
overall O
good O
restaurant O
with O
really O
good O
seafood O
. O

This O
is O
right O
up O
there O
with O
places O
in O
Tokyo O
as O
far O
as O
the O
freshness O
is O
concerned O
. O

Best O
Indian O
Chinese O
in O
the O
city O
, O
by O
far O
! O

Never O
fails O
to O
please O
. O

Best O
Sushi O
in O
town O
. O

Have O
eaten O
at O
Ginger O
House O
several O
times O
, O
and O
it's O
always O
good O
. O

Leave O
room O
for O
dessert O
. O

Spreads O
and O
toppings O
are O
great O
- O
though O
a O
bit O
pricey O
. O

I O
plan O
on O
stopping O
by O
next O
week O
as O
well O
. O

When O
I O
walked O
in O
, O
I O
was O
taken O
aback O
by O
their O
incredible O
wood O
decor O
. O

My O
party O
of O
two O
was O
feeling O
particularly O
ambitious O
, O
and O
we O
splurged O
on O
the O
Shilshole O
Sampler O
... O
a O
beautiful O
assortment O
of O
enormous O
white O
gulf O
prawns O
, O
smoked O
albacore O
tuna O
, O
Ray's O
fantastic O
manila O
clams O
seasoned O
with O
dill O
, O
scallops O
in O
a O
tasty O
soy O
dressing O
, O
and O
a O
tiny O
pile O
of O
Dungeness O
crab O
atop O
a O
sublime O
butter O
sauce O
. O

Drinks O
were O
good O
. O

The O
food O
and O
service O
were O
fine O
, O
however O
the O
maitre-D O
was O
incredibly O
unwelcoming O
and O
arrogant O
. O

Beef O
noodle O
soup O
is O
good O
as O
well O
. O

Snooze O
provided O
an O
inventive O
pancake O
offering O
, O
but O
Le O
Peep O
would O
have O
provided O
better O
service O
and O
quality O
. O

The O
bagels O
always O
warm O
, O
soft O
on O
the O
inside O
, O
crispy O
on O
the O
outside O
and O
enormous O
in O
size O
. O

The O
chana O
masala O
( O
garbanzo O
beans O
) O
are O
also O
excellent O
. O

My O
friends O
settled O
for O
rice O
dishes O
, O
but O
we O
came O
back O
the O
following O
day O
to O
try O
the O
dim O
sum O
, O
which O
was O
good O
... O
not O
outstanding O
, O
but O
good O
. O

Will O
never O
be O
back O
. O

– O
Mioposto O
has O
a O
very O
creative O
& O
delicious O
pizza O
menu O
. O

The O
service O
is O
fantastic O
at O
this O
fun O
place O
. O

Our O
server O
continued O
to O
be O
attentive O
throughout O
the O
night O
, O
but O
I O
did O
remain O
puzzled O
by O
one O
issue O
: O
Who O
thinks O
that O
Ray's O
is O
an O
appropriate O
place O
to O
take O
young O
children O
for O
dinner O
? O

Overall O
, O
decent O
food O
at O
a O
good O
price O
, O
with O
friendly O
people O
. O

The O
dinner O
was O
ok O
, O
nothing O
I O
would O
have O
again O
. O

I O
love O
breakfast O
here O
. O

Vanison O
was O
good O
but O
not O
amazing O
. O

Fantastic O
place O
. O

I O
asked O
the O
chef O
what O
he O
recommends O
and O
he O
asked O
me O
if O
I O
like O
Uni O
. O
( O

The O
hot O
dogs O
are O
top O
notch O
, O
and O
they're O
Slamwich O
is O
amazing O
! O

This O
is O
a O
twenty-something O
guy O
that O
doesn't O
mind O
laying O
down O
$ O
300 O
for O
a O
fine O
and O
delicious O
meal O
for O
2 O
on O
special O
occassions O
. O

The O
food O
was O
not O
fresh O
, O
the O
sauces O
were O
bland O
and O
very O
oily O
. O

It's O
a O
great O
place O
to O
enjoy O
food O
and O
meet O
friends O
. O

But O
$ O
1 O
for O
each O
small O
piece O
? O
? O
? O

The O
prices O
were O
CHEAP O
compared O
to O
the O
quality O
of O
service O
and O
food O
. O

Will O
prob O
. O
not O
return O
but O
it O
is O
a O
great O
dinning O
experience O
to O
try O
atleast O
once O
. O

If O
you O
are O
the O
type O
of O
person O
who O
likes O
being O
scared O
and O
entertained O
, O
this O
is O
a O
great O
place O
to O
go O
and O
eat O
. O

Seriously O
, O
you O
can't O
go O
wrong O
, O
if O
it O
is O
unpretentious O
local O
fun O
you O
seek O
. O

Hey O
, O
I O
think O
$ O
2 O
+ O
for O
a O
5 O
block O
walk O
ain't O
bad O
. O

After O
sitting O
there O
with O
my O
empty O
glass O
for O
over O
20 O
minutes O
I O
left O
. O

Groovy O
music O
made O
the O
dinner O
casual O
. O

Polite O
acknowledgement O
is O
out O
; O

It's O
a O
little O
out O
of O
our O
price O
range O
for O
dining O
there O
except O
on O
special O
occasions O
, O
but O
we've O
eaten O
there O
6 O
times O
in O
the O
last O
2 O
years O
. O

Service O
ok O
but O
unfriendly O
, O
filthy O
bathroom O
. O

The O
cold O
appetizer O
dishes O
taste O
like O
the O
way O
I O
remember O
them O
to O
taste O
when O
I O
was O
growing O
up O
in O
Taiwan O
. O

There O
was O
a O
really O
nice O
vibe O
about O
the O
place O
... O
good O
music O
, O
atmosphere O
and O
happy O
looking O
people O
. O

Wasn't O
going O
to O
share O
but O
I O
feel O
obligated O
... O
while O
sitting O
at O
the O
sushi O
bar O
dining O
we O
watched O
the O
chef O
accidentally O
drop O
a O
piece O
of O
Unagi O
on O
the O
floor O
and O
upon O
retrieving O
it O
from O
the O
floor O
proceed O
to O
use O
the O
piece O
in O
the O
delivery O
order O
he O
was O
preparing O
. O

However O
, O
our O
$ O
14 O
drinks O
were O
were O
horrible O
! O

Moderate O
prices O
. O

Personally O
I O
like O
the O
margherita O
pizza O
better O
, O
but O
they O
are O
all O
good O
. O

Save O
room O
for O
scrumptious O
desserts O
. O

We O
all O
ordered O
different O
entrees O
so O
we O
could O
share O
. O

A O
different O
server O
enhanced O
the O
fun O
, O
dumping O
our O
entrees O
in O
front O
of O
us O
halfway O
through O
our O
appetizer O
( O
which O
was O
delicious O
) O
. O

They O
have O
a O
wide O
variety O
of O
fish O
and O
they O
even O
list O
which O
oceans O
they O
come O
from O
; O
Atlantic O
or O
Pacific O
. O

I O
waited O
for O
10-15 O
minutes O
for O
service O
ordered O
a O
beer O
& O
was O
never O
served O
again O
. O

I O
have O
eaten O
at O
some O
of O
the O
' O
best O
' O
sushi O
joints O
in O
NYC O
( O
Nobu O
, O
Bond O
Street O
, O
JewelBako O
, O
etc O
) O
and O
Yamato O
is O
my O
favorite O
. O

It's O
somewhere O
you O
can O
eat O
and O
be O
happy O
. O

Should O
check-up O
on O
us O
more O
frequently O
, O
don't O
you O
think O
? O

Not O
a O
great O
place O
for O
family O
or O
general O
dining O
. O

I've O
had O
my O
fair O
share O
of O
modern O
Japanese O
and O
this O
spot O
delivers O
. O

BUt O
once O
done O
, O
it's O
not O
too O
much O
dough O
, O
not O
too O
much O
cheese O
, O
not O
too O
much O
sauce O
. O

We O
waited O
at O
the O
bar O
and O
had O
martinis O
that O
were O
just O
right O
. O

I O
came O
here O
with O
my O
boyfriend O
for O
our O
anniversary O
because O
it O
was O
highly O
recommended O
to O
him O
by O
a O
friend O
. O

– O
IT O
CANT O
GET O
ANY O
BETTER O
! O
! O
! O

The O
sushi O
seemed O
pretty O
fresh O
and O
was O
adequately O
proportioned O
. O

so O
about O
the O
prawns O
, O
they O
were O
fresh O
and O
had O
a O
slight O
crispiness O
about O
the O
batter O
... O
soooo O
good O
... O
the O
walnuts O
were O
cut O
in O
smaller O
pieces O
and O
very O
crunchy O
and O
tasty O
. O

A O
big O
disappointment O
, O
all O
around O
. O

They O
have O
a O
delicious O
banana O
chocolate O
dessert O
, O
as O
well O
as O
a O
great O
green O
tea O
tempura O
. O

even O
the O
wine O
by O
the O
glass O
was O
good O
. O

Authentic O
Taiwanese O
food O
that's O
cheap O
... O
what O
more O
could O
you O
ask O
for O
? O

The O
food O
is O
great O
and O
they O
have O
a O
good O
selecion O
of O
wines O
at O
reasonable O
prices O
. O

While O
finishing O
our O
meals O
which O
included O
a O
high-end O
bottle O
of O
wine O
, O
our O
son's O
fiance O
joined O
us O
for O
a O
glass O
of O
wine O
and O
dessert O
. O

$ O
170 O
down O
the O
toilet O
... O

amazing O
fun O
for O
hot O
dog O
lovers O
of O
all O
ages O
PLEASE O
do O
yourself O
a O
favor O
and O
check O
this O
place O
out O
! O
! O
! O

My O
boyfriend O
had O
the O
New O
England O
Chowder O
it O
was O
good O
but O
I O
think O
the O
award O
should O
go O
to O
the O
Lobster O
Bisque O
. O

The O
manager O
was O
rude O
and O
handled O
the O
situation O
extremely O
poorly O
. O

You'll O
be O
ther O
for O
every O
anniversary O
, O
birthday O
, O
valentines O
day O
... O

The O
quantity O
is O
also O
very O
good O
, O
you O
will O
come O
out O
satisfied O
. O

Save O
yourself O
the O
time O
and O
trouble O
and O
skip O
this O
one O
! O

Try O
everything O
for O
that O
matter O
, O
it O
is O
all O
good O
. O

We O
thought O
that O
this O
place O
is O
using O
too O
much O
of O
MSG O
cooking O
in O
the O
foods O
. O

Okay-i O
don't O
mind O
the O
oily O
part O
( O
cause O
most O
are O
cooked O
that O
way O
) O
but O
it O
was O
way O
too O
bland O
. O

we O
are O
for O
sure O
coming O
back O
to O
this O
restaurant O
. O

Service O
is O
not O
what O
you O
are O
coming O
here O
for O
... O

I O
got O
the O
shellfish O
and O
shrimp O
appetizer O
and O
it O
was O
alright O
. O

I've O
eaten O
at O
Pizza O
Gruppo O
a O
few O
times O
, O
but O
more O
often O
I O
order O
delivery O
. O

I O
was O
very O
disappointed O
with O
this O
restaurant O
. O

The O
food O
is O
great O
. O

My O
wife O
and O
I O
visited O
Dokebi O
tonight O
. O

They O
should O
have O
called O
it O
mascarpone O
with O
chocolate O
chips-good O
but O
a O
far O
cry O
from O
what O
the O
name O
implies O
. O

I O
took O
my O
boyfriend O
for O
a O
dinner O
on O
saturday O
night O
. O

There O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
variety O
even O
for O
people O
who O
eat O
vegetarian O
like O
me O
. O

Faan O
is O
sooo O
good O
. O

I O
ordered O
the O
smoked O
salmon O
and O
roe O
appetizer O
and O
it O
was O
off O
flavor O
. O

I O
should O
have O
just O
asked O
for O
the O
check O
when O
I O
saw O
that O
; O
but O
their O
menu O
was O
so O
unique O
that O
I O
continued O
. O

The O
place O
was O
quiet O
and O
delightful O
. O

I O
went O
there O
2times O
. O

Portions O
was O
just O
enough O
for O
me O
, O
but O
may O
not O
be O
for O
a O
big O
eater O
. O

The O
DJ O
is O
awesome O
, O
I O
have O
been O
there O
for O
my O
birthday O
and O
a O
bunch O
of O
other O
times O
with O
friends O
and O
I O
keep O
going O
back O
. O

The O
food O
is O
authentic O
Italian O
- O
delicious O
! O

This O
place O
is O
really O
trendi O
but O
they O
have O
forgotten O
about O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
a O
restaurant O
, O
the O
food O
. O

If O
we O
were O
to O
move O
from O
the O
upper O
east O
side O
, O
we O
would O
genuinely O
miss O
this O
restaurant O
. O

I O
went O
there O
with O
some O
friends O
one O
night O
to O
play O
bingo O
and O
watch O
the O
sox O
game O
and O
it O
was O
a O
blast O
! O

Planet O
Thai O
is O
great O
! O

– O
We O
were O
treated O
very O
rudely O
here O
one O
time O
for O
breakfast O
. O

– O
I've O
been O
to O
over O
a O
dozen O
Indian O
places O
in O
L O
. O
A O
. O
, O
and O
this O
is O
still O
my O
favorite O
. O

Possibly O
the O
Most O
Romantic O
Restaurant O
in O
the O
City O

Yeah O
the O
crowd O
can O
take O
it O
a O
bit O
seriously O
, O
but O
it O
shouldn't O
. O

Best O
Reuben O
sandwich O
ever O
! O

I O
/ O
we O
will O
never O
go O
back O
to O
this O
place O
again O
. O

You O
are O
bound O
to O
have O
a O
very O
charming O
time O
. O

– O
This O
is O
one O
of O
my O
top O
lunch O
spots O
, O
huge O
portions O
, O
fast O
service O
and O
amazing O
margaritas O
! O
! O

My O
party O
had O
the O
BBE O
$ O
29 O
fixe O
prix O
menu O
, O
which O
was O
such O
a O
wonderful O
deal O
since O
it O
also O
came O
with O
a O
flight O
of O
sake O
! O

My O
girlfiends O
and O
I O
ate O
at O
O O
. O
G O
. O
again O
last O
night O
. O

I'm O
not O
sure O
where O
the O
other O
reviewers O
ate O
but O
it O
seems O
as O
if O
we O
visited O
two O
different O
restaurants O
because O
my O
friends O
and O
I O
all O
enjoy O
Mizu O
very O
much O
... O
and O
we're O
repeat O
customers O
. O

BEST O
DINING O
EXPERIENCE O
IN O
THE O
WEST O
VILLAGE O
! O

great O
food O

The O
food O
was O
excellent O
as O
well O
as O
service O
, O
however O
, O
I O
left O
The O
Four O
Seasons O
very O
dissappointed O
. O

That O
was O
the O
last O
night O
in O
Vegas O
and O
was O
too O
late O
and O
most O
of O
the O
restaurant O
were O
closing O
- O
so O
we O
walked O
in O
the O
check O
the O
place O
. O

The O
people O
that O
work O
there O
are O
always O
so O
friendly O
you O
forget O
you O
are O
in O
New O
York O
sometimes O
. O

Fresh O
ingrediants O
and O
super O
tasty O
. O

I O
found O
it O
on O
a O
cold O
night O
, O
the O
perfect O
spot O
to O
warm O
up O
. O

Maybe O
it O
is O
good O
for O
that O
one O
night O
once O
in O
a O
blue O
moon O
when O
the O
chefs O
decide O
to O
use O
fish O
that's O
half-way O
decent O
. O

I O
come O
from O
a O
family O
of O
pizzeria O
owners O
, O
and O
I'm O
almost O
ashamed O
to O
say O
that O
the O
pizza O
in O
Fornino's O
blows O
my O
families O
receipies O
away O
. O

The O
seats O
are O
uncomfortable O
if O
you O
are O
sitting O
against O
the O
wall O
on O
wooden O
benches O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
the O
restaurant O
based O
on O
our O
experience O
last O
night O
. O

My O
only O
negative O
comment O
is O
that O
I O
wish O
the O
pieces O
were O
a O
little O
bigger O
. O

I O
may O
not O
be O
a O
sushi O
guru O
but O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
that O
the O
food O
here O
is O
just O
okay O
and O
that O
there O
is O
not O
much O
else O
to O
it O
. O

Ravioli O
was O
good O
... O
but O
I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
I O
found O
everything O
a O
bit O
overpriced O
. O

A O
gentleman O
, O
maybe O
the O
manager O
, O
came O
to O
our O
table O
, O
and O
without O
so O
much O
as O
a O
smile O
or O
greeting O
asked O
for O
our O
order O
. O

I O
like O
Cafe O
Noir O
dont O
get O
me O
wrong O
, O
it O
is O
jsut O
that O
the O
people O
who O
work O
there O
are O
evil O
and O
incompetent O
! O
! O

Truly O
the O
mark O
of O
an O
attentive O
waiter O
. O

They O
were O
very O
abrupt O
with O
me O
when O
I O
called O
and O
actually O
claimed O
the O
food O
was O
late O
because O
they O
were O
out O
of O
rice O
. O

The O
chicken O
curry O
and O
chicken O
tikka O
masala O
are O
my O
favorite O
meat O
dishes O
. O

The O
have O
over O
100 O
different O
beers O
to O
offer O
thier O
guest O
so O
that O
made O
my O
husband O
very O
happy O
and O
the O
food O
was O
delicious O
, O
if O
I O
must O
recommend O
a O
dish O
it O
must O
be O
the O
pumkin O
tortelini O
. O

I O
wasn't O
thrilled O
to O
have O
to O
wait O
on O
line O
for O
thirty O
minutes O
, O
but O
I O
guess O
that's O
the O
price O
you O
pay O
for O
a O
popular O
place O
. O

Taxan O
delicious O
! O

Authentic O
Korean O
food O
lovers O
should O
visit O
32nd O
Street O
, O
of O
course O
. O

Well O
I O
guess O
it's O
hard O
to O
be O
seated O
when O
one O
is O
invisible O
to O
the O
staff O
. O

great O
service O
. O

Just O
want O
to O
warn O
you O
all O
- O
don't O
waste O
your O
time O
and O
money O
. O

I O
went O
here O
for O
a O
family O
birthday O
dinner O
. O

This O
place O
is O
worth O
an O
one-hour O
drive O
. O

We O
called O
the O
other O
person O
who O
was O
very O
close O
by O
, O
and O
she O
told O
us O
to O
order O
for O
her O
, O
so O
we O
did O
. O

It's O
just O
the O
right O
size O
for O
the O
menu O
. O

We O
are O
very O
particular O
about O
sushi O
and O
were O
both O
please O
with O
every O
choice O
which O
included O
: O
ceviche O
mix O
( O
special O
) O
, O
crab O
dumplings O
, O
assorted O
sashimi O
, O
sushi O
and O
rolls O
, O
two O
types O
of O
sake O
, O
and O
the O
banana O
tempura O
. O

yummy O
. O

I O
attended O
a O
holiday O
dinner O
at O
the O
restaurant O
, O
and O
the O
food O
was O
majorly O
disappointing O
. O

it O
gets O
really O
busy O
, O
so O
get O
there O
on O
the O
early O
side O
so O
you O
can O
grab O
a O
seat O
, O
if O
you O
do O
have O
to O
wait O
, O
its O
not O
bad O
because O
the O
service O
is O
quick O
! O

Downtown O
Dinner O
2002 O
- O
Prixe O
fix O
: O
Appetizers O
were O
ok O
, O
waiter O
gave O
me O
poor O
suggestion O
.. O
try O
the O
potato O
stuff O
kanish O
best O
one O
. O

The O
service O
is O
ok O
, O
some O
of O
the O
people O
didn't O
get O
what O
they O
asked O
for O
. O

A O
perfect O
place O
to O
take O
out O
of O
town O
guests O
any O
time O
of O
the O
year O
. O

I've O
had O
the O
Jellyfish O
, O
Horse O
Mackerel O
, O
Blue O
Fin O
Tuna O
and O
the O
Sake O
Ikura O
roll O
among O
others O
, O
and O
they O
were O
all O
good O
. O

The O
characters O
really O
make O
for O
an O
enjoyable O
experience O
. O

This O
place O
is O
a O
great O
bargain O
. O

The O
outdoor O
atmosphere O
of O
sitting O
on O
the O
sidewalk O
watching O
the O
world O
go O
by O
50 O
feet O
away O
on O
6th O
avenue O
on O
a O
cool O
evening O
was O
wonderful O
. O

How O
is O
this O
palce O
still O
open O
? O

All O
their O
menu O
items O
are O
a O
hit O
, O
and O
they O
serve O
mimosas O
. O

To O
their O
credit O
they O
removed O
the O
dish O
from O
the O
check O
; O
but O
no O
manager O
stopped O
by O
to O
ask O
what O
the O
problem O
was O
. O

Had O
an O
awful O
experience O
at O
Casa O
la O
Femme O
on O
a O
Saturday O
dinner O
. O

Food O
was O
good O
and O
the O
view O
of O
the O
new O
york O
city O
skiline O
was O
terrific O
even O
on O
a O
foggy O
rainy O
day O
like O
that O
of O
when O
I O
went O
. O

Great O
bottle O
of O
wine O
. O

I O
recieved O
prompt O
service O
with O
a O
smile O
. O

The O
food O
they O
serve O
is O
not O
comforting O
, O
not O
appetizing O
and O
uncooked O
. O

then O
we O
ordered O
a O
dinosaur O
rolls O
and O
white O
tuna O
sashimi O
. O

Watch O
the O
talented O
belly O
dancers O
as O
you O
enjoy O
delicious O
baba O
ganoush O
that's O
more O
lemony O
than O
smoky O
. O

THE O
BIG O
COMPLAINT O
: O
NO O
TOASTING O
AVAILABLE O
. O

Seafood O
Plus O

– O
Pretty O
cheap O
for O
sit O
down O
Mexican O
AND O
downtown O
. O

But O
they O
do O
. O

The O
place O
is O
small O
and O
cramped O
but O
the O
food O
is O
fantastic O
. O

I O
noticed O
alot O
of O
indian O
people O
eatting O
there O
which O
is O
a O
great O
sign O
for O
an O
indian O
place O
! O

I O
would O
highly O
recommand O
requesting O
a O
table O
by O
the O
window O
. O

The O
combination O
of O
super-fresh O
ingredients O
in O
the O
dishes O
are O
unusual O
but O
really O
delicious O
. O

My O
boyfriend O
asked O
me O
if O
I O
wanted O
to O
switch O
and O
eat O
his O
salmon O
instead O
, O
while O
he O
de-skinned O
the O
chicken O
so O
that O
I O
could O
enjoy O
the O
white O
meat O
. O

Overpriced O

When O
I O
got O
there O
the O
place O
was O
packed O
but O
they O
made O
sure O
to O
seat O
me O
quickly O
. O

There O
is O
no O
excuse O
for O
such O
lousy O
service O
! O

The O
scallops O
are O
apparently O
cooked O
in O
a O
black O
olive O
butter O
which O
really O
makes O
them O
unique O
( O
not O
to O
mention O
tasty O
) O
. O

You O
can't O
say O
its O
cheap O
because O
food O
is O
cheaper O
in O
Chinatown O
. O

We O
easily O
spent O
more O
than O
$ O
40 O
per O
person O
( O
not O
including O
alcohol O
) O
and O
were O
still O
hungry O
. O

It O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
fun O
with O
live O
entertainment O
and O
all O
kinds O
of O
Disney O
type O
special O
effects O
. O

Their O
bagels O
are O
fine O
, O
but O
they O
are O
a O
little O
overcooked O
, O
and O
not O
really O
a O
' O
special O
' O
bagel O
experience O
. O

Great O
spot O
, O
whether O
looking O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
drinks O
or O
quiet O
dinner O
. O

The O
svc O
can O
be O
a O
bit O
rude O
at O
times O
, O
esp O
if O
you O
have O
big O
group O
, O
but O
overall O
the O
restaurant O
is O
a O
must O
! O

Great O
food O
, O
great O
prices O
, O
great O
service O
. O

Someone O
else O
recommended O
the O
dessert O
- O
we O
also O
left O
that O
. O

Finally O
, O
my O
wife O
stood O
face O
to O
face O
in O
front O
of O
one O
of O
the O
staff O
and O
she O
asked O
, O
" O
Are O
you O
waiting O
for O
a O
table O
? O
" O

Good O
, O
fast O
service O
. O

less O
wait O
time O
for O
me O
! O

I O
was O
looking O
for O
banana O
tempura O
for O
dessert O
and O
they O
dont O
have O
. O

I'm O
a O
born O
and O
bred O
Southend O
resident O
and O
was O
excited O
to O
hear O
of O
this O
restaurant O
opening O
. O

The O
wine O
list O
is O
also O
really O
nice O
. O

Dumbfoundingly O
Poor O

Warning O
: O
You O
may O
find O
it O
difficult O
to O
dine O
at O
other O
Japanese O
restaurants O
after O
a O
visit O
to O
Mizu O
! O

We O
were O
seated O
right O
away O
, O
the O
table O
was O
private O
and O
nice O
. O

I O
love O
sushi O
, O
and O
I O
have O
eaten O
it O
all O
over O
the O
world O
. O

For O
those O
that O
go O
once O
and O
don't O
enjoy O
it O
, O
all O
I O
can O
say O
is O
that O
they O
just O
don't O
get O
it O
. O

it's O
a O
perfect O
place O
to O
have O
a O
amanzing O
indian O
food O
. O

Everything O
I O
had O
was O
good O
, O
and O
I'm O
a O
eater O
. O

It O
is O
obvious O
that O
no O
one O
in O
the O
restaurant O
has O
any O
idea O
about O
or O
experience O
with O
Japanese O
cuisine O
. O

They O
were O
such O
a O
rip-off O
( O
$ O
8.95 O
for O
four O
small O
meat O
patties O
in O
steamed O
buns O
) O
and O
not O
worth O
trying O
. O

Not O
worth O
it O
. O

The O
hostess O
said O
" O
Wow O
that's O
a O
large O
group O
, O
unless O
you O
aren't O
together O
" O
, O
to O
which O
I O
replied O
" O
no O
we O
are O
, O
and O
there O
will O
be O
one O
more O
, O
so O
a O
table O
for O
six O
please O
. O
" O

Servers O
are O
all O
different O
, O
Greg O
is O
my O
favorite O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
you O
can O
do O
here O
is O
walk O
in O
and O
eat O
.. O
but O
planning O
an O
event O
, O
especially O
a O
small O
, O
intimate O
one O
, O
forget O
about O
it O
. O

Service O
was O
slow O
had O
to O
wait O
to O
order O
and O
get O
food O
although O
not O
crowded O
. O

We O
were O
very O
disappointed O
. O

The O
reason O
there O
are O
4 O
different O
results O
on O
citysearch O
for O
the O
same O
place O
is O
because O
they O
keep O
trying O
to O
start O
a O
new O
thread O
so O
they O
can O
stock O
it O
with O
positive O
reviews O
. O

Given O
that O
Ray's O
is O
a O
seafood O
restaurant O
... O
well O
, O
you O
get O
the O
idea O
... O

We O
were O
planning O
to O
get O
dessert O
but O
the O
waitress O
basically O
through O
the O
bill O
at O
us O
before O
we O
had O
a O
chance O
to O
order O
. O

The O
ambiance O
was O
a O
peaceful O
and O
relaxing O
break O
amongst O
all O
the O
kids O
running O
around O
in O
Downtown O
Disney O
. O

The O
restaurant O
was O
80 O
% O
full O
and O
there O
was O
a O
sign O
posted O
" O
wait O
to O
be O
seated O
. O
" O

BUT O
not O
in O
a O
good O
way O
. O

good O
music O
, O
great O
food O
, O
speedy O
service O
affordable O
prices O
. O

I O
don't O
know O
if O
I'll O
be O
back O
... O

After O
hearing O
a O
lot O
of O
great O
things O
about O
the O
restaurant O
, O
and O
passing O
by O
it O
on O
a O
daily O
basis O
, O
we O
decided O
to O
try O
. O

I O
don't O
think O
I O
would O
go O
again O
. O

You O
can O
order O
to O
go O
if O
you O
have O
to O
get O
back O
to O
the O
office O
too O
! O

I O
have O
never O
eaten O
in O
the O
restaurant O
, O
however O
, O
upon O
reading O
the O
reviews O
I O
got O
take O
out O
last O
week O
. O

The O
food O
is O
so O
cheap O
and O
the O
waiters O
are O
nice O
. O

I O
can't O
! O
! O
! O

The O
wife O
had O
the O
risotto O
which O
was O
amazing O
. O

It O
may O
be O
a O
bit O
packed O
on O
weekends O
, O
but O
the O
vibe O
is O
good O
and O
it O
is O
the O
best O
French O
food O
you O
will O
find O
in O
the O
area O
. O

– O
... O
and O
the O
best O
summertime O
deck O
experience--they O
will O
even O
bring O
you O
a O
blanket O
if O
you O
get O
cold O
in O
the O
Seattle O
evening O
weather O
. O

I O
have O
been O
to O
Rao's O
probably O
15 O
times O
the O
past O
3 O
years O
and O
it O
keeps O
getting O
better O
. O

The O
only O
positive O
thing O
about O
Mioposto O
is O
the O
nice O
location O
. O

However O
, O
our O
main O
course O
was O
wonderful O
. O

Never O
again O
! O

Their O
specialty O
rolls O
are O
impressive O
, O
though O
I O
can't O
remember O
what O
we O
had O
. O

The O
ambience O
was O
so O
fun O
, O
and O
the O
prices O
were O
great O
, O
on O
top O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
food O
was O
really O
tasty O
. O

The O
seafood O
is O
amazing O
, O
there's O
a O
good O
wine O
list O
, O
and O
the O
ever-changing O
menu O
always O
offers O
some O
great O
surprises O
. O

I O
will O
be O
going O
back O
very O
soon O
. O

The O
have O
a O
great O
cocktail O
with O
Citrus O
Vodka O
and O
lemon O
and O
lime O
juice O
and O
mint O
leaves O
that O
is O
to O
die O
for O
! O

The O
food O
was O
mediocre O
at O
best O
but O
it O
was O
the O
horrible O
service O
that O
made O
me O
vow O
never O
to O
go O
back O
. O

I O
really O
loved O
the O
different O
and O
inovated O
touch O
that's O
the O
cheff O
gives O
to O
the O
food O
. O

We O
did O
tip O
, O
I O
guess O
the O
model O
/ O
waitress O
just O
wanted O
more O
and O
complained O
to O
the O
manager O
. O

The O
food O
is O
flavorful O
, O
plentiful O
and O
reasonably O
priced O
. O

So O
, O
I O
switch O
with O
my O
boyfriend O
again O
to O
see O
if O
maybe O
I O
could O
stomach O
the O
meat O
and O
spinach O
again O
, O
but O
the O
spinach O
was O
so O
undercooked O
that O
I O
just O
could O
not O
bite O
through O
it O
. O

Some O
Pineapple O
covered O
in O
a O
glaze O
of O
some O
kind O
and O
some O
pear O
tart O
thing O
Not O
impressive O
at O
all O
. O

plenty O
of O
food O
, O
trust O
me O
. O

Thank O
you O

– O
My O
family O
went O
on O
a O
midweek O
evening O
to O
have O
dinner O
. O

I O
am O
relatively O
new O
to O
the O
area O
and O
tried O
Pick O
a O
bgel O
on O
2nd O
and O
was O
disappointed O
with O
the O
service O
and O
I O
thought O
the O
food O
was O
overated O
and O
on O
the O
pricey O
side O
. O

But O
the O
pizza O
is O
way O
to O
expensive O
. O

A O
great O
place O
to O
meet O
up O
for O
some O
food O
and O
drinks O
... O

Go O
hungry O
and O
enjoy O
. O

– O
Every O
neighborhood O
has O
a O
few O
great O
local O
bars O
that O
are O
the O
best O
secrets O
. O

Go O
with O
some O
friends O
, O
wait O
the O
half O
hour O
or O
so O
with O
a O
cup O
of O
joe O
, O
and O
enjoy O
more O
than O
your O
average O
breakfast O
. O

I O
love O
this O
place O

Maybe O
it O
has O
improved O
since O
then O
? O

When O
we O
inquired O
about O
ports O
- O
the O
waitress O
listed O
off O
several O
but O
did O
not O
know O
taste O
variations O
or O
cost O
. O

The O
mussles O
were O
the O
fishiest O
things O
I've O
ever O
tasted O
, O
the O
seabass O
was O
bland O
, O
the O
goat O
cheese O
salad O
was O
missing O
the O
goat O
cheese O
, O
the O
penne O
w O
/ O
chicken O
had O
bones O
in O
it O
... O
It O
was O
disgusting O
. O

I O
grew O
up O
on O
these O
bagels O
. O

The O
food O
however O
, O
is O
what O
one O
might O
expect O
. O

Eat O
at O
your O
own O
risk O
. O

This O
is O
the O
first O
place O
I've O
been O
that O
a O
runner O
remembers O
my O
order O
... O
hope O
he O
likes O
his O
job O
because O
I O
have O
half O
a O
mind O
to O
steal O
him O
for O
my O
restaurant O
. O

Well O
, O
this O
place O
is O
so O
Ghetto O
its O
not O
even O
funny O
. O

Prices O
are O
very O
good O
. O

I O
recommend O
it O
! O

I O
couldn't O
ignore O
the O
fact O
that O
she O
reach O
over O
the O
plate O
of O
one O
of O
my O
friends O
, O
who O
was O
in O
mid O
bite O
, O
to O
clear O
the O
table O
. O

it O
helps O
if O
you O
know O
what O
to O
order O
. O

Open O
late O
( O
well O
as O
late O
as O
I O
ever O
got O

Best O
Italian O
food O
I O
ever O
had O
( O
and O
being O
Italian O
, O
that O
means O
alot O
) O
. O

This O
place O
is O
not O
inviting O
and O
the O
food O
is O
totally O
weird O
. O

My O
father O
had O
the O
flank O
steak O
which O
was O
very O
good O
, O
and O
my O
mother O
had O
the O
swordfish O
. O

The O
drinks O
are O
always O
welll O
made O
and O
wine O
selection O
is O
fairly O
priced O
. O

it's O
the O
only O
place O
you O
can O
get O
yummy O
authentic O
japanese O
comfort O
food O
. O

I O
go O
here O
at O
least O
once O
every O
other O
week O
, O
particularly O
when O
it's O
cold O
! O

Her O
review O
is O
above O

The O
food O
is O
great O
and O
they O
make O
a O
mean O
bloody O
mary O

The O
pepperoni's O

thick--Yum O

Great O
Atmosphere O

I O
went O
to O
this O
restaurant O
with O
a O
woman O
that O
I O
met O
recently O
. O

enough O
said O

This O
place O
is O
always O
very O
crowded O
and O
popular O
. O

An O
excellent O
service O

Food O
was O
very O
good O
, O
but O
not O
what O
I O
would O
consider O
out O
of O
this O
world O
. O

– O
Had O
to O
wait O
thirty O
minutes O
to O
get O
in O
the O
door O
on O
a O
tuesday O
morning O
, O
but O
it O
was O
so O
worth O
it O
. O

– O
Mercedes O
restaurant O
is O
so O
tasty O
, O
the O
service O
is O
undeniably O
awesome O
! O

Serves O
really O
good O
sushi O
. O

She O
replied O
" O
well O
it O
would O
be O
more O
convenient O
for O
us O
if O
you O
ordered O
now O
, O
since O
you O
are O
a O
larger O
party O
, O
and O
it O
might O
get O
crowded O
. O
" O

Everything O
I've O
had O
here O
is O
good O
, O
taco O
salads O
, O
burritos O
, O
enchiladas O
i O
love O
this O
place O
. O

The O
place O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
fun O
. O

What O
a O
find O
! O

Been O
there O
lots O
since O
and O
its O
always O
a O
good O
time O
. O

my O
favorite O
place O
lol O

good O
sake O
, O
good O
food O
– O
i O
honestly O
don't O
know O
much O
about O
japanese O
food O
at O
all O
. O

My O
wife O
and O
I O
went O
to O
Water's O
Edge O
for O
a O
romantic O
dinner O
. O

great O
toppings O
definitely O
a O
place O
you O
need O
to O
check O
out O
for O
late O
night O
munchies O
or O
a O
mid O
day O
boost O
! O

I O
had O
their O
eggs O
benedict O
for O
brunch O
, O
which O
were O
the O
worst O
in O
my O
entire O
life O
, O
I O
tried O
removing O
the O
hollondaise O
sauce O
completely O
that O
was O
how O
failed O
it O
was O
. O

The O
hostess O
is O
rude O
to O
the O
point O
of O
being O
offensive O
. O

We O
could O
have O
made O
a O
meal O
of O
the O
yummy O
dumplings O
from O
the O
dumpling O
menu O
. O

the O
pad O
se O
ew O
chicken O
was O
delicious O
, O
however O
the O
pad O
thai O
was O
far O
too O
oily O
. O

While O
their O
kitchen O
food O
is O
delicious O
, O
their O
Sushi O
is O
out O
of O
this O
world O
. O

I O
can't O
wait O
to O
go O
back O
. O

So O
rude O
! O
! O
! O

Blue O
Ribbon O
lives O
up O
to O
it's O
fantastic O
reputation O
. O

It O
is O
expensive O
but O
well O
worth O
the O
money O
. O

The O
hanger O
steak O
was O
like O
rubber O
and O
the O
tuna O
was O
flavorless O
not O
to O
mention O
it O
tasted O
like O
it O
had O
just O
been O
thawed O
. O

All O
in O
all O
we're O
already O
coming O
up O
with O
excuses O
to O
go O
ahead O
really O
soon O
in O
the O
next O
few O
wks O
! O
! O
! O

Loved O
It O

Furthermore O
, O
while O
the O
fish O
is O
unquestionably O
fresh O
, O
rolls O
tend O
to O
be O
inexplicably O
bland O
. O

Service O
was O
also O
very O
good O
. O

Though O
, O
one O
thing O
I O
realized O
later O
on O
was O
that O
the O
restaurant O
either O
used O
MSG O
or O
a O
meat O
tenderizer O
on O
the O
steak O
. O

You O
cannot O
go O
wrong O
at O
the O
Red O
Eye O
Grill O
. O

noodles O
with O
shrimp O
and O
chicken O
and O
coconut O
juice O
is O
the O
MUST O
! O

I O
had O
the O
duck O
breast O
special O
on O
my O
last O
visit O
and O
it O
was O
incredible O
. O

The O
server O
was O
really O
cool O
and O
served O
us O
our O
food O
and O
drinks O
with O
a O
smile O
. O

Check O
this O
place O
out O
! O

If O
you're O
in O
the O
area O
you O
shouldn't O
be O
disappointed O
. O

It O
was O
steamed O
and O
tossed O
with O
garlic O
. O

And O
I've O
been O
to O
many O
NYC O
delis O
. O

Not O
impressed O
with O
the O
food O
. O

The O
coffe O
is O
very O
good O
, O
too O
. O

LOL O

It's O
to O
die O
for O
! O

Go O
there O
to O
relax O
and O
feel O
like O
your O
somewhere O
else O
. O

JUST O
AWSOME O
. O

A O
great O
choice O
at O
any O
cost O
and O
a O
great O
deal O
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
I O
would O
return O
- O
as O
it O
was O
a O
beautiful O
restaurant O
- O
but O
I O
hope O
the O
staff O
pays O
more O
attention O
to O
the O
little O
details O
in O
the O
future O
. O

Maggot O
in O
the O
food O
! O

I O
wish O
they O
would O
change O
back O
to O
what O
it O
was O
before O
. O

We O
recently O
decided O
to O
try O
this O
location O
, O
and O
to O
our O
delight O
, O
they O
have O
outdoor O
seating O
, O
perfect O
since O
I O
had O
my O
yorkie O
with O
me O
. O

they O
were O
dry O
and O
disgusting O
, O
i O
didn't O
even O
finish O
my O
first O
piece O
. O

Cute O
and O
decorative O
. O

No O
desert O
menu O
, O
no O
apology O
, O
nothing O
! O
! O
! O

This O
place O
survives O
on O
reputation O
alone O
. O

Run O
don't O
walk O
. O

The O
fried O
dumplings O
are O
GREAT O
! O

I O
ate O
here O
a O
week O
ago O
and O
found O
most O
dishes O
average O
at O
best O
and O
too O
expensive O
. O

The O
food O
is O
decent O
at O
best O
, O
and O
the O
ambience O
, O
well O
, O
it's O
a O
matter O
of O
opinion O
, O
some O
may O
consider O
it O
to O
be O
a O
sweet O
thing O
, O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
just O
annoying O
. O

Wonderful O
strawberry O
daiquiries O
as O
well O
! O

They O
forgot O
a O
sandwich O
, O
didn't O
include O
plastic O
forks O
, O
and O
didn't O
include O
pita O
with O
the O
hummus O
platter O
. O

By O
the O
time O
we O
finished O
our O
dinner O
we O
still O
had O
not O
received O
one O
beverage O
NOR O
hooka O
! O

If O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
good O
quality O
, O
cheap O
eats O
- O
this O
is O
the O
place O
. O

every O
month O
if O
possible O
. O

I O
love O
Indian O
food O
and O
consider O
myself O
to O
be O
quite O
an O
expert O
on O
it O
. O

If O
you O
don't O
mind O
pre-sliced O
low O
quality O
fish O
, O
unfriendly O
staff O
and O
a O
sushi O
chef O
that O
looks O
like O
he O
is O
miserable O
then O
this O
is O
your O
place O
. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
take O
out O
from O
here O
3-4 O
times O
a O
month O
. O

It O
was O
divine O
melts O
in O
your O
mouth O
. O

We O
ate O
at O
this O
Thai O
place O
following O
the O
reviews O
but O
very O
unhappy O
with O
the O
foods O
. O

The O
presentation O
of O
the O
food O
was O
an O
added O
bonus O
, O
it O
looked O
just O
as O
great O
as O
it O
tasted O
! O

It O
was O
wonderful O
. O

That's O
a O
huge O
compliment O
, O
especially O
in O
the O
fickled O
restaurant O
business O
, O
... O
enough O
already O
! O

We O
paid O
and O
left O
because O
we O
didn't O
feel O
like O
arguing O
any O
more O
. O

any O
further O
needs O
we O
may O
have O
had O
could O
not O
have O
been O
met O
since O
no O
one O
stopped O
by O
the O
table O
. O

While O
this O
diner O
had O
reasonably O
good O
food O
, O
the O
restaurant O
staff O
seemed O
completely O
indifferent O
to O
our O
presence O
, O
and O
this O
attitude O
was O
reflected O
in O
the O
lack O
of O
service O
. O

We O
won't O
go O
to O
this O
place O
again O
for O
a O
good O
meal O
. O

The O
decor O
however O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
distraction O
so O
you O
won't O
notice O
that O
you O
just O
payed O
300 O
bucks O
for O
some O
cold O
eggplant O
that O
took O
2 O
FRICKIN O
HOURS O
TO O
COME O
! O
! O
! O

Don't O
get O
me O
started O
on O
the O
margaritas O
, O
either O
. O

The O
Seafood O
Dynamite O
is O
also O
otherworldly O
. O

BTW O
, O
I O
really O
like O
Long O
Beach O
. O

I O
love O
it O
. O

It O
was O
absolutely O
amazing O
. O

I O
have O
been O
going O
there O
since O
it O
opened O
and O
I O
can't O
get O
enough O
. O

They O
charge O
different O
prices O
all O
the O
time O
. O

In O
about O
12 O
minutes O
, O
the O
thing O
is O
gone O
. O

Not O
only O
is O
the O
cuisine O
the O
best O
around O
, O
the O
service O
has O
always O
been O
attentive O
and O
charming O
. O

The O
food O
we O
ordered O
was O
excellent O
, O
although O
I O
wouldn't O
say O
the O
margaritas O
were O
anything O
to O
write O
home O
about O
. O

I O
was O
almost O
amused O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
she O
was O
turning O
away O
customers O
at O
9pm O
on O
a O
Friday O
night O
because O
she O
" O
had O
a O
BBQ O
to O
go O
to O
" O
that O
night O
- O
WTF O
? O
? O

We O
go O
often O
for O
lunch O
and O
the O
place O
is O
packed O
. O

You O
never O
feel O
icky O
and O
stuffed O
after O
you O
eat O
there O
. O

We O
ended O
our O
great O
experience O
by O
having O
Gulab O
Jamun O
( O
dessert O
) O
recommended O
by O
the O
waiter O
. O

The O
service O
was O
fast O
and O
friendly O
and O
the O
food O
was O
very O
tasty O
and O
they O
had O
the O
best O
hot O
sauce O
to O
add O
to O
your O
meals O
. O

The O
service O
was O
excellent O
and O
the O
food O
was O
delicious O
. O

Wine O
list O
selection O
is O
good O
and O
wine-by-the-glass O
was O
generously O
filled O
to O
the O
top O
. O

– O
By O
far O
the O
best O
bar O
in O
the O
east O
village O
... O

I O
went O
there O
with O
a O
friend O
from O
out O
of O
town O
... O
and O
we O
were O
both O
very O
impressed O
! O

I O
generally O
like O
this O
place O
. O

By O
far O
the O
best O
salad O
I O
have O
had O
in O
a O
fast O
food O
restaurant O
. O

Mazing O
interior O
. O

A O
little O
noise O
but O
I O
think O
that O
was O
because O
of O
our O
party O
! O

I O
picked O
the O
asparagus O
, O
which O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
incredible O
and O
perfectly O
prepared O
. O

Once O
seated O
it O
took O
about O
30 O
minutes O
to O
finally O
get O
the O
meal O
. O

I O
have O
lived O
in O
Japan O
for O
7 O
years O
and O
the O
taste O
of O
the O
food O
and O
the O
feel O
of O
the O
restaurant O
is O
like O
being O
back O
in O
Japan O
. O

Unique O
apppetizers O
. O

I O
found O
the O
food O
, O
service O
and O
value O
exceptional O
everytime O
I O
have O
been O
there O
. O

We O
are O
locals O
, O
and O
get O
the O
feeling O
the O
only O
way O
this O
place O
survives O
with O
such O
average O
food O
is O
because O
most O
customers O
are O
probably O
one-time O
customer O
tourists O
. O

The O

here O
is O
delicious O

( O

) O
turnip O
cakes O
at O
the O
little O
kiosk O
on O
east O
side O
of O
Mott O
St O
. O
just O
south O
of O
bayard O

It O
was O
decent O
but O
nothing O
exceptional O
. O

I O
loved O
everythig O
about O
it-especially O
the O
shows O
and O
actors O
. O

It O
was O
pretty O
inexpensive O
too O
. O

Also O
, O
there O
was O
only O
one O
bathroom O
stall O
- O
probably O
need O
more O
for O
such O
big O
crowds O
. O

Open O
& O
Cool O
Place O
with O
the O
Best O
Pizza O
and O
Coffee O

Do O
not O
get O
the O
Go O
Go O
Hamburgers O
, O
no O
matter O
what O
the O
reviews O
say O
. O

The O
food O
is O
great O
and O
reasonably O
priced O
. O

I O
think O
the O
stuff O
was O
better O
than O
Disney O
. O

Since O
we O
were O
already O
waiting O
so O
long O
, O
we O
felt O
we O
had O
no O
other O
choice O
but O
to O
accept O
it O
. O

The O
first O
time O
the O
sushi O
was O
outstanding O
, O
the O
second O
time O
it O
was O
a O
little O
bland O
. O

We O
have O
gone O
for O
dinner O
only O
a O
few O
times O
but O
the O
same O
great O
quality O
and O
service O
is O
given O
. O

honestly O
the O
worst O
sushi O
my O
husband O
and O
i O
had O
in O
our O
entire O
lives O
. O

Somehow O
working O
the O
italian O
charm O
with O
constant O
mille O
grazie O
does O
not O
constitute O
proper O
service O
. O

Atmosphere O
was O
nice O
. O

hidden O
little O
jem O

THE O
SERVICE O
IS O
AMAZING O
, O
i've O
had O
different O
waiters O
and O
they O
were O
all O
nice O
, O
which O
is O
a O
rare O
thing O
in O
NYC O
. O

If O
you O
don't O
like O
it O
, O
I O
don't O
know O
what O
to O
tell O
you O
. O

The O
blond O
wood O
decor O
is O
very O
soothing O
, O
the O
premium O
sake O
is O
excellent O
and O
the O
service O
is O
great O
. O

Patsy's O
Pizza O
= O
true O
love O

All O
the O
various O
Greek O
and O
Cypriot O
dishes O
are O
excellent O
, O
but O
the O
gyro O
is O
the O
reason O
to O
come--if O
you O
don't O
eat O
one O
your O
trip O
was O
wasted O
. O

If O
you O
can O
, O
come O
to O
this O
place O
by O
boat O
and O
make O
it O
a O
whole O
evening O
. O

As O
to O
my O
comment O
about O
the O
food O
, O
no O
apology O
or O
acknowledgment O
was O
made O
. O

When O
we O
threatened O
to O
leave O
, O
we O
were O
offered O
a O
meager O
discount O
even O
though O
half O
the O
order O
was O
missing O
. O

Consistently O
good O
Japanese O
Tapas O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
visiting O
this O
restaurant O
and O
having O
dinner O
and O
drinks O
! O

Dinners O
have O
always O
been O
excellent O
, O
in O
terms O
of O
food O
quality O
. O

The O
Dancing O
, O
White O
River O
and O
Millenium O
rolls O
are O
musts O
. O

– O
Love O
their O
pizza O
, O
especially O
the O
mushroom O
pizza O
. O

Perfect O
on O
a O
cold O
day O
. O

Big O
Wong O
gets O

a O
fine O

. O

Unless O
you O
are O
just O
stopping O
in O
for O
a O
few O
drinks O
I O
wouldn't O
recommend O
going O
here O
. O

Most O
importantly O
, O
we O
were O
so O
excited O
about O
the O
food O
after O
seeing O
the O
very O
creative O
menu O
. O

They O
never O
brought O
us O
complimentary O
noodles O
, O
ignored O
repeated O
requests O
for O
sugar O
, O
and O
threw O
our O
dishes O
on O
the O
table O
. O

Yes O
, O
it O
is O
good O
, O
but O
I've O
had O
better O
for O
cheaper O
. O

Freshest O
sushi O
– O
I O
love O
this O
restaurant O
. O

Very O
" O
normal O
Indian O
food O
" O
, O
but O
done O
really O
well O
. O

We O
ordered O
the O
marinated O
grapes O
, O
buffalo O
style O
chicken O
wings O
, O
and O
the O
turkey O
sandwich O
. O

The O
food O
was O
amazing O
, O
and O
the O
service O
was O
prompt O
and O
helpful O
, O
but O
not O
over-bearing O
or O
rushed O
. O

Saul O
is O
the O
best O
restaurant O
on O
Smith O
Street O
and O
in O
Brooklyn O
. O

Can't O

wait O
for O
my O
next O
visit O

With O
so O
many O
poor O
experiences O
to O
be O
had O
in O
the O
theater O
district O
, O
is O
truly O
an O
excellent O
find O
! O

i O
love O
their O
chicken O
pasta O
cant O
remember O
the O
name O
but O
is O
sooo O
good O

But O
that O
wasn't O
the O
icing O
on O
the O
cake O
: O
a O
tiramisu O
that O
resembled O
nothing O
I O
have O
ever O
had O
. O

Delivery O
can O
be O
spot O
on O
or O
lacking O
depending O
on O
the O
weather O
and O
the O
day O
of O
the O
week O
. O

The O
food O
now O
is O
inconsistent O
. O

great O
beer O

Maybe O
it O
was O
the O
great O
company O
( O
I O
had O
friends O
visiting O
from O
Philly O
– O
yes O
, O
it O
was O
not O
a O
date O
this O
time O
) O
or O
the O
super O
reasonable O
price O
point O
, O
but O
I O
just O
can O
’ O
t O
say O
enough O
good O
things O
about O
this O
brasserie O
. O

The O
lemon O
chicken O
tasted O
like O
sticky O
sweet O
donuts O
and O
the O
honey O
walnut O
prawns O
, O
the O
few O
they O
actually O
give O
you O
... O
were O
not O
good O
. O

Which O
lets O
face O
it O
... O
at O
times O
it's O
a O
good O
thing O
. O

Drinks O
way O
over O
priced O
. O

Its O
located O
in O
greenewich O
village O
. O

It's O
a O
great O
little O
place O
with O
tons O
of O
potential O
to O
be O
a O
neighborhood O
joint O
if O
the O
service O
weren't O
so O
impersonal O
and O
corporate-like O
. O

We O
never O
ate O
because O
by O
close O
to O
2 O
in O
the O
monring O
we O
were O
not O
served O
and O
were O
too O
upset O
ad O
tired O
to O
start O
eating O
. O

I O
have O
eaten O
at O
many O
pizza O
places O
around O
NYC O
and O
this O
is O
hands O
down O
the O
worst O
. O

To O
be O
honest O
we O
only O
ever O
eat O
the O
Shabu O
Shabu O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
Roxy's O
for O
that O
, O
but O
not O
for O
their O
food O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
I O
finished O
my O
plate O
, O
and O
that's O
when O
I O
found O
a O
maggot O
in O
mushroom O
sauce O
at O
the O
bottom O
. O

Drinks O
are O
suberb O
, O
and O
I O
feel O
like O
I O
am O
in O
a O
Third O
World O
country O
when O
I O
walk O
in O
the O
door O
. O

Murray O
won't O
do O
it O
. O

Winnie O
and O
her O
staff O
are O
the O
best O
crew O
you O
can O
find O
serving O
you O
. O

Decor O
is O
nice O
though O
service O
can O
be O
spotty O
. O

If O
you O
like O
the O
food O
and O
the O
value O
you O
get O
from O
some O
of O
Chinatown O
restaurants O
, O
this O
is O
not O
the O
place O
for O
you O
. O

Although O
the O
tables O
may O
be O
closely O
situated O
, O
the O
candle-light O
, O
food O
- O
quality O
and O
service O
overcompensate O
. O

A O
beef O
Consomme O
. O

Downstairs O
lounge O
is O
always O
a O
good O
attraction O

They O
are O
opening O
two O
more O
places O
as O
i O
saw O
a O
flyer O
there O
one O
in O
Yonkers O
which O
is O
a O
restraunt O
and O
banquet O
hall O
and O
another O
one O
in O
parsipanny O
new O
jersey O
. O

– O
We O
love O
breakfast O
food O
. O

great O
lunch O
spot O

Going O
to O
Bark O
is O
always O
worth O
the O
train O
ride O
, O
and O
will O
make O
your O
tongue O
and O
belly O
very O
happy O
! O

We O
shared O
the O
family O
platter O
and O
I O
especially O
enjoyed O
the O
black O
cod O
in O
sake O
kasu O
. O

But O
the O
best O
part O
about O
LS O
is O
the O
late O
night O
atmosphere O
, O
delightfully O
free O
of O
the O
BTs O
. O

She O
then O
put O
the O
check O
down O
without O
asking O
if O
we O
were O
done O
, O
and O
came O
to O
check O
on O
the O
bill O
every O
two O
minutes O
, O
even O
though O
we O
were O
one O
of O
three O
occupied O
tables O
. O

Their O
tuna O
tartar O
appetizer O
is O
to O
die O
for O
. O

Highly O
recommended O
! O

My O
wife O
also O
ordered O
a O
teapot O
of O
hot O
water O
( O
she O
had O
a O
sore O
throat O
) O
and O
I O
guess O
that O
since O
it O
was O
only O
water O
, O
it O
wasn't O
a O
priority O
for O
them O
to O
actually O
bring O
it O
. O

The O
dinner O
only O
took O
us O
about O
an O
hour O
and O
the O
prices O
were O
alright O
for O
the O
strip O
, O
almost O
$ O
50 O
/ O
pp O
after O
tax O
and O
tip O
( O
about O
average O
) O
. O

She O
doesn't O
make O
you O
feel O
welcome O
and O
treats O
you O
like O
an O
annoyance O
. O

I O
would O
say O
that O
all O
was O
fine O
and O
tasty O
but O
the O
heaviness O
on O
my O
stomach O
someting O
that O
i O
can't O
not O
mention O
or O
undermine O
. O

the O
only O
problem O
is O
you O
really O
have O
to O
warm O
up O
the O
pizza O
before O
it's O
edible O
, O
even O
when O
you O
order O
ahead O
. O

I'll O
being O
with O
a O
couple O
of O
positives O
: O
cool O
decor O
, O
good O
pita O
and O
hummus O
, O
and O
grilled O
octopus O
that O
was O
actually O
pretty O
tasty O
. O

If O
the O
weather O
is O
nice O
, O
try O
to O
snag O
an O
outside O
table O
. O

They O
serve O
it O
in O
a O
tall O
, O
skinny O
hour-glass O
shaped O
glass O
to O
disguise O
the O
fact O
that O
you O
a O
getting O
a O
small O
juice O
at O
the O
price O
of O
a O
half O
gallon O
in O
a O
supermarket O
. O

You'll O
pay O
at O
least O
double O
at O
any O
other O
Italian O
restaurant O
in O
the O
city O
, O
and O
most O
still O
don't O
compare O
. O

And O
the O
Tom O
Kha O
soup O
was O
pathetic O
. O

The O
Four O
Seasons O
has O
history O
and O
it O
is O
a O
sort O
of O
landmark O
of O
New O
York O
City O
restaurants O
, O
but O
trust O
me O
, O
they O
will O
charge O
you O
through O
the O
nose O
just O
so O
that O
you O
can O
say O
" O
I've O
been O
to O
the O
four O
seasons O
restaurant O
" O
. O

When O
you O
add O
it O
all O
together O
, O
it O
just O
doesn't O
seem O
worth O
it O
to O
me O
... O
especially O
considering O
the O
prices O
. O

Right O
off O
the O
L O
in O
Brooklyn O
this O
is O
a O
nice O
cozy O
place O
with O
good O
pizza O
. O

Steamed O
fresh O
so O
brought O
hot O
hot O
hot O
to O
your O
table O
. O

The O
wine O
the O
service O
was O
very O
good O
too O
. O

Overall O
the O
food O
quality O
was O
pretty O
good O
, O
though O
I O
hear O
the O
salmon O
is O
much O
better O
when O
it O
hasn't O
sat O
cooling O
in O
front O
of O
the O
guest O
. O

The O
restaurant O
looks O
out O
over O
beautiful O
green O
lawns O
to O
the O
Hudson O
River O
and O
the O
Statue O
of O
Liberty O
. O

if O
you're O
daring O
, O
try O
the O
balsamic O
vinegar O
over O
icecream O
, O
it's O
wonderful O
! O

the O
atmosphere O
is O
great O
. O

The O
staff O
has O
been O
nice O
, O
but O
they O
seemed O
really O
stressed O
and O
the O
unisex O
bathroom O
needs O
to O
be O
cleaned O
more O
often O
. O

Food O
was O
amazing O
- O
I O
love O
Indian O
food O
and O
eat O
it O
quite O
regularly O
, O
but O
I O
can O
say O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
I've O
had O
. O

Best O
meal O
in O
a O
long O
time O
! O

Great O
pizza O
and O
fantastic O
service O
. O

Located O
at O
the O
end O
of O
a O
magnificent O
block O
. O

Can O
’ O
t O
believe O
how O
an O
expensive O
NYC O
restaurant O
can O
be O
so O
disrespectful O
to O
its O
clients O
. O

Unbelievable O
. O

i've O
been O
to O
sapphire O
twice O
and O
both O
times O
the O
food O
was O
fine O
, O
if O
not O
good O
. O

i O
happen O
to O
have O
a O
policy O
that O
goes O
along O
with O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
self-respect O
, O
which O
includes O
not O
letting O
a O
waiter O
intimidate O
me O
, O
i O
. O
e O
. O
make O
me O
feel O
bad O
asking O
for O
trivialities O
like O
water O
, O
or O
the O
check O
. O

great O
meal O
– O
the O
fish O
on O
the O
omikase O
platter O
was O
absolutely O
decadent O
- O
- O
there O
was O
none O
of O
the O
stringiness O
that O
sometimes O
accompanies O
fair O
sushi O
- O
- O
this O
fish O
was O
perfect O
! O
! O
! O

The O
ambience O
was O
nice O
, O
but O
service O
wasn't O
so O
great O
. O

– O
Eggs O
, O
pancakes O
, O
potatoes O
, O
fresh O
fruit O
and O
yogurt O
- O
- O
everything O
they O
serve O
is O
delicious O
. O

His O
response O
was O
smug O
, O
arrogant O
, O
and O
condescending O
, O
totally O
consistent O
with O
his O
deportment O
on O
display O
all O
evening O
. O

Went O
on O
a O
Monday O
night O
, O
so O
there O
was O
no O
wait O
for O
a O
table O
. O

Too O
many O
other O
good O
places O
to O
have O
to O
settle O
. O

I'd O
definitely O
go O
back O
again O
. O

you O
are O
with O
a O
hot O
date O
and O
he O
/ O
she O
has O
an O
urge O
for O
sushi O
... O
then O
this O
might O
be O
the O
place O
. O

However O
, O
this O
place O
is O
a O
gem O
, O
and O
I O
won't O
stop O
going O
back O
. O

this O
place O
had O
ALL O
the O
trimmings O
and O
i O
mean O
all O
. O

I O
picked O
the O
Grilled O
Black O
Cod O
as O
my O
entree O
, O
which O
I O
absolutely O
devoured O
while O
someone O
commented O
that O
the O
Grilled O
Salmon O
dish O
was O
better O
. O

Everyone O
must O
come O
here O
at O
least O
once O
. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
dine O
with O
large O
party O
, O
I O
recommend O
to O
make O
reservation O
BASEMENT O

Our O

very O
helpful O
and O
friendly O
. O

And O
$ O

for O
a O
plate O
of O
bland O
guacamole O
? O

go O
here O
for O
the O
drinks O
! O

Give O
it O
a O
try O
and O
enjoy O
. O

Gorgeous O
place O
ideal O
for O
a O
romantic O
dinner O

Delicate O
spices O
, O
onions O
, O
eggs O
and O
a O
kick-ass O
roti O
. O

Don't O
judge O
this O
place O
prima O
facie O
, O
you O
have O
to O
try O
it O
to O
believe O
it O
, O
a O
home O
away O
from O
home O
for O
the O
literate O
heart O
. O

Definitely O
a O
great O
spot O
for O
a O
nice O
occasion O
or O
date O
. O

Get O
the O
tuna O

My O
wife O
and O
I O
always O
enjoy O
the O
young O
, O
not O
always O
well O
trained O
but O
nevertheless O
friendly O
, O
staff O
, O
all O
of O
whom O
have O
a O
story O
. O

Good O
food O
. O

Pacifico O
is O
a O
great O
place O
to O
casually O
hang O
out O
. O

This O
place O
is O
a O
must O
visit O
! O

The O
owner O
and O
staff O
are O
all O
Japanese O
as O
well O
and O
that O
adds O
to O
the O
entire O
ambiance O
. O

Lives O
up O
to O
the O
hype O

The O
music O
playing O
was O
very O
hip O
, O
20-30 O
something O
pop O
music O
, O
but O
the O
subwoofer O
to O
the O
sound O
system O
was O
located O
under O
my O
seat O
, O
which O
became O
annoying O
midway O
through O
dinner O
. O

I O
believe O
there O
were O
2 O
shrimp O
in O
the O
" O
salt O
encrusted O
shrimp O
" O
appetizer O
. O

Not O
sure O
where O
the O
previous O
reviewer O
, O
lonk O
, O
dined O
, O
but O
Saul O
is O
in O
a O
great O
neighborhood O
and O
has O
great O
food O
! O

We O
will O
be O
back O
. O

Much O
more O
reasonably O
priced O
too O
! O

Still O
, O
any O
quibbles O
about O
the O
bill O
were O
off-set O
by O
the O
pour-your-own O
measures O
of O
liquers O
which O
were O
courtesey O
of O
the O
house O
... O

Place O
is O
open O
till O
late O
, O
no O
dress O
code O
. O

And O
the O
service O
was O
simply O
spendid O
- O
quite O
a O
delight O
. O

The O
spicy O
Tuna O
roll O
is O
huge O
and O
probably O
the O
best O
that O
I've O
had O
at O
this O
price O
range O
. O

I'm O
telling O
you O
... O

Another O
review O
here O
claimed O
the O
pre-fix O
was O
$ O
29 O
/ O
per O
person O
including O
sake O
but O
it O
is O
$ O
55 O
per O
person O
not O
including O
sake O
. O

Staff O
is O
very O
accomodating O
. O

Service O
was O
very O
prompt O
but O
slightly O
rushed O
. O

Many O
people O
talk O
about O
the O
great O
pizza O
and O
poor O
service O
, O
so O
it O
can't O
just O
be O
the O
rantings O
of O
a O
few O
dissatisfied O
customers O
. O

the O
fish O
was O
fresh O
, O
though O
it O
was O
cut O
very O
thin O
. O

never O
swaying O
, O
never O
a O
bad O
meal O
, O
never O
bad O
service O
... O

I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
I O
am O
pleasantly O
suprised O
and O
I O
will O
most O
likely O
stop O
in O
again O
if O
I O
am O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
. O

best O
chinese O
food O
i O
have O
tasted O
in O
a O
long O
time O

well O
, O
i O
didn't O
find O
it O
there O
, O
and O
trust O
, O
i O
have O
told O
everyone O
i O
can O
think O
of O
about O
my O
experience O
. O

i O
highly O
recommend O
this O
place O
to O
all O
that O
want O
to O
try O
indain O
food O
for O
the O
first O
time O
. O

The O
waitress O
was O
not O
attentive O
at O
all O
. O

Be O
sure O
to O
try O
the O
oyster O
roll O
. O

Looking O
around O
, O
I O
saw O
a O
room O
full O
of O
New O
Yorkers O
enjoying O
a O
real O
meal O
in O
a O
real O
restaurant O
, O
not O
a O
clubhouse O
of O
the O
fabulous O
trying O
to O
be O
seen O
. O

If O
only O
they O
delivered O
, O
they'd O
make O
a O
mint O
! O

it O
is O
not O
consistent O
. O

Excellent O
food O
, O
although O
the O
interior O
could O
use O
some O
help O
. O

I O
recently O
tried O
Suan O
and O
I O
thought O
that O
it O
was O
great O
. O

The O
food O
is O
simply O
unforgettable O
! O

I O
ordered O
the O
vitello O
alla O
marsala O
and O
I O
was O
pretty O
impressed O
. O

I O
complained O
to O
the O
manager O
, O
but O
he O
was O
not O
even O
apologetic O
. O

We O
had O
Lava O
Cake O
... O
we O
ordered O
when O
our O
food O
came O
it O
takes O
at O
least O
a O
1/2 O
to O
make O
it O
. O

The O
food O
was O
good O
too O
. O

it's O
delicious O
! O

The O
service O
ranges O
from O
mediocre O
to O
offensive O
. O

The O
only O
downside O
... O
they O
only O
take O
cash O
which O
is O
OK O
if O
you O
know O
about O
it O
ahead O
of O
time O
. O

My O
quesadilla O
tasted O
like O
it O
had O
been O
made O
by O
a O
three-year O
old O
with O
no O
sense O
of O
proportion O
or O
flavor O
. O

( O
The O
asparagus O
, O
truffle O
oil O
, O
parmesan O
bruschetta O
is O
a O
winner O
! O
) O

We're O
going O
back O
. O
:D O

The O
food O
looked O
very O
appetizing O
and O
delicious O
since O
it O
came O
on O
a O
variety O
of O
fancy O
plates O
. O

We O
have O
tried O
every O
Thai O
restaurant O
between O
Atlantic O
Avenue O
and O
4th O
Streets O
, O
and O
Joya O
is O
the O
best O
. O

Seabass O
on O
lobster O
risotto O
was O
the O
best O
. O

I O
came O
across O
Village O
Underground O
by O
accident O
, O
now O
I O
go O
there O
all O
the O
time O
. O

The O
atmosphere O
isn't O
the O
greatest O
, O
but O
I O
suppose O
that's O
how O
they O
keep O
the O
prices O
down O
. O

Too O
bad O
I O
had O
paid O
an O
extra O
$ O
2 O
for O
the O
stone O
bowl O
. O

Overall O
, O
I O
would O
go O
back O
and O
eat O
at O
the O
restaurant O
again O
. O

This O
restaurant O
is O
VEGETARIAN O
; O
there O
are O
NO O
MEAT O
dishes O
whatsoever O
. O

Starters O
: O
Kobe O
Beef O
Sashimi O
. O

We've O
lived O
in O
the O
area O
for O
more O
than O
8 O
years O
. O

The O
staff O
is O
very O
good O
. O

You O
must O
have O
the O
crabmeat O
lasagna O
which O
is O
out O
of O
this O
world O
and O
the O
chocolate O
bread O
pudding O
for O
dessert O
. O

Try O
the O
lobster O
teriyaki O
and O
the O
rose O
special O
roll O
. O

After O
that O
she O
simply O
took O
our O
plates O
, O
walked O
away O
, O
came O
back O
another O
TWENTY O
minutes O
later O
with O
the O
bill O
and O
the O
chicken O
on O
it O
! O
! O
! O

Wine O
list O
is O
extensive O
without O
being O
over-priced O

My O
daughter's O
wedding O

at O

Edge O
received O
the O
highest O
compliments O
from O
our O

keep O
up O
the O
good O
work O
. O

Volare O
virgins O
or O
weekly O
regulars O
, O
everyone O
gets O
treated O
the O
same O
and O
you O
can't O
ask O
for O
more O
than O
that O
when O
the O
service O
is O
this O
friendly O
. O

Whose O
writing O
all O
the O
great O
reviews O
? O

I O
absolutely O
love O
this O
place O
! O
! O
! O

Conveniently O
located O
too O
, O
being O
right O
on O
Bedford O
ave O
. O

Very O
Disappointing O

Chow O
fun O
was O
dry O
; O
pork O
shu O
mai O
was O
more O
than O
usually O
greasy O
and O
had O
to O
share O
a O
table O
with O
loud O
and O
rude O
family O
. O

It O
hits O
the O
spot O
every O
time O

The O
sushi O
is O
amazing O
! O
! O
! O

I O
CAN O
EAT O
HERE O
EVERY O
DAY O
OF O
THE O
WEEK O
REALLY O
LOL O
LOVE O
THIS O
PLACE O
... O
) O

I O
don't O
appreciate O
places O
or O
people O
that O
try O
to O
drive O
up O
the O
bill O
without O
the O
patron's O
knowledge O
so O
that O
was O
a O
huge O
turnoff O
( O
more O
than O
the O
price O
) O
. O

The O
food O
was O
average O
or O
above O
including O
some O
surprising O
tasty O
dishes O
. O

The O
sushi O
was O
awful O
! O

I'm O
astonished O
that O
this O
restaurant O
is O
categorized O
as O
$ O
$ O
$ O
rather O
than O
$ O
$ O
$ O
. O

my O
service O
was O
stellar O
! O

I'd O
go O
back O
there O
in O
a O
heartbeat O
. O

However O
it O
is O
the O
ONLY O
Taiwanese O
restaurant O
in O
town O
. O

The O
decor O
is O
rustic O
, O
traditional O
Japanese O
. O

great O
taste O

Waited O
35 O
minutes O
for O
a O
table O
for O
8 O
which O
was O
ok O
for O
such O
a O
big O
crowd O
. O

I O
don't O
get O
it O
either O
. O

The O
food O
arrived O
20 O
minutes O
after O
I O
called O
, O
cold O
and O
soggy O
. O

Such O
a O
disappointment O
... O

I O
look O
forward O
to O
eating O
here O
again O

What O
really O
makes O
it O
shine O
is O
the O
food O
, O
which O
is O
aggressively O
seasoned O
with O
Cyrpriot O
spices O
, O
and O
all O
made O
in-house O
( O
even O
the O
gyro O
meat O
and O
sausages O
) O
, O
and O
made O
of O
much O
higher O
quality O
ingredients O
that O
might O
otherwise O
be O
expected O
. O

I O
made O
my O
1st O
trip O
to O
the O
restaurant O
after O
finding O
their O
webpage O
online O
. O

The O
servers O
at O
Flatbush O
Farm O
appear O
to O
have O
perfected O
that O
ghastly O
technique O
of O
making O
you O
feel O
guilty O
and O
ashamed O
for O
deigning O
to O
attract O
their O
attention O
. O

Hurley's O
is O
like O
Cheers O
where O
everyone O
knows O
your O
name O
and O
they O
are O
ACTUALLY O
glad O
you O
came O
. O

For O
starters O
they O
delivered O
us O
someone O
else's O
order O
. O

I O
am O
so O
coming O
back O
here O
again O
, O
as O
much O
as O
I O
can O
. O

Please O
be O
aware O
that O
it's O
CASH O
or O
AMEX O
only O
! O

I O
though O
it O
was O
expensive O
and O
I O
prefer O
Bella O
Via O
just O
blocks O
away O
by O
far O
. O

I O
heard O
the O
lobster O
roll O
was O
excellent O
. O

Oh O
, O
and O
there's O
hookah O
. O

Had O
no O
flavor O
and O
the O
staff O
is O
rude O
and O
not O
attentive O
. O

The O
wine O
list O
is O
interesting O
and O
has O
many O
good O
values O
. O

Overpriced O
and O
not O
tasty O

food O
was O
luke O
warm O
. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
both O
ordered O
the O
Steak O
, O
medium O
. O

What O
may O
be O
interesting O
to O
most O
is O
the O
worst O
sevice O
/ O
attitude O
comes O
from O
the O
owners O
of O
this O
establishment O
. O

I'm O
saving O
up O
for O
my O
next O
visit O
. O

I O
have O
never O
left O
a O
restaurant O
feeling O
as O
if O
i O
was O
abused O
, O
and O
wasted O
my O
hard O
earned O
money O
. O

the O
2 O
listed O
and O
then O
one O
in O
Southglenn O
mall O
parking O
lot O
which O
is O
reviewed O
here O
and O
one O
in O
Ft O
Collins O
. O

Took O
my O
mom O
for O
Mother's O
Day O
, O
and O
the O
maitre O
d O
' O
was O
pretty O
rude O
. O

Come O
on O
. O

And O
amazingly O
cheap O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
plates O
were O
just O
dumped O
on O
the O
table O
, O
I O
was O
handed O
the O
wine O
list O
upside O
down O
, O
etc O
... O

I O
got O
an O
excellent O
piece O
of O
cheesecake O
and O
we O
had O
several O
other O
nice O
pastries O
. O

( O
Besides O
that O
there O
should O
be O
more O
restaurants O
like O
it O
around O
the O
city O
) O
. O

We O
order O
a O
bit O
of O
everything O
on O
the O
menu O
. O

We O
thought O
the O
dessert O
would O
be O
better O
, O
Wrong O
! O

( O
2 O
) O
egg O
custards O
and O
pork O
buns O
at O
either O
bakery O
on O
west O
side O
of O
Mott O
street O
just O
south O
of O
Canal O
. O

Ess-A-Bagel O
( O
either O
by O
Sty-town O
or O
midtown O
) O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
bagel O
in O
NY O
. O

Perfection O
. O

instead O
ordered O
an O
ice O
cold O
beer O
which O
to O
me O
works O
with O
indian O
. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
have O
been O
sold O
on O
this O
from O
the O
first O
visit O
. O

The O
staff O
was O
accomodating O
, O
the O
food O
was O
absolutely O
delicious O
and O
the O
place O
is O
lovely O
. O

It's O
just O
average O
, O
just O
shredded O
, O
no O
seasoning O
on O
it O
. O

Amazing O
food O
. O

I O
completely O
recommend O
Casa O
La O
Femme O
for O
any O
special O
occasion O
and O
to O
REALLY O
impress O
your O
date O
. O

Their O
crab O
eggs O
benedict O
is O
addicting O
. O

Not O
one O
of O
our O
meals O
was O
edible O
- O
bland O
and O
/ O
or O
made O
with O
weird O
rosemary O
or O
orange O
flavoring O
. O

The O
entire O
staff O
was O
extremely O
accomodating O
and O
tended O
to O
my O
every O
need O
. O

In O
any O
event O
, O
this O
is O
a O
place O
I'll O
be O
sure O
to O
stop O
by O
again O
when O
I'm O
in O
this O
part O
of O
town O
. O

If O
you're O
into O
being O
lost O
when O
you're O
just O
five O
feet O
from O
your O
table O
then O
hey O
, O
that's O
a O
good O
thing O
. O

We O
liked O
it O
so O
much O
, O
that O
we O
will O
always O
make O
it O
a O
point O
to O
dine O
here O
when O
we O
visit O
New O
York O
. O

If O
you O
go O
, O
try O
the O
marinara O
/ O
arrabiatta O
sauce O
, O
the O
mozzarella O
en O
Carozza O
is O
mmmmmmmm O
... O
everything O
is O
just O
delicious O
. O

its O
just O
a O
fun O
place O
to O
go O
, O
not O
a O
five O
star O
restaraunt O
. O

The O
pesto O
pizza O
was O
excellent O
, O
thin-crust O
pizza O
with O
a O
nice O
amount O
of O
spicy O
Italian O
cheese O
that O
I'd O
never O
heard O
of O
before O
. O

During O
our O
trip O
to O
NYC O
, O
we O
made O
reservations O
to O
dine O
in O
the O
pool O
room O
of O
the O
Four O
Seasons O
for O
their O
pre-theater O
menu O
( O
offering O
a O
modified O
menu O
for O
$ O
65 O
pp O
) O
. O

Easily O
the O
worst O
stir-fried O
squid O
I've O
ever O
tasted O
. O

Same O
owner O
as O
the O
guy O
who O
owns O
Typhoon O
, O
which O
is O
just O
down O
the O
street O
on O
St O
. O
Marks O
and O
1st O
Ave O
. O

– O
Ray's O
( O
suprisingly O
) O
has O
the O
city's O
BEST O
& O
most O
diverse O
wine O
list O
. O

Probably O
would O
not O
go O
back O
here O
. O

We O
will O
go O
back O
every O
time O
we O
are O
in O
the O
City O
. O

Sit O
in O
the O
Balcony O

we O
have O
been O
there O
3 O
times O
since O
last O
week O
we O
alked O
it O
by O
chance O
first O
day O
the O
manager O
offerd O
us O
the O
margherita O
pizza O
adn O
we O
said O
yes O
. O

A O
word O
to O
the O
wise O
: O
you O
can't O
dine O
here O
and O
disturb O
the O
maitre-D O
' O
s O
sense O
of O
" O
table O
turnover O
" O
, O
as O
whacked O
as O
it O
is O
, O
or O
else O
. O

Bring O
your O
cell O
phone O
cause O
you O
may O
have O
to O
wait O
to O
get O
into O
the O
best O
sushi O
restaurant O
in O
the O
world O
: O
BLUE O
RIBBON O
SUSHI O
. O

We O
left O
, O
never O
to O
return O
. O

I O
was O
speechless O
by O
the O
horrible O
food O
. O

Not O
sure O
if O
I O
would O
go O
back O
. O

Salads O
are O
a O
delicious O
way O
to O
begin O
the O
meal O
. O

The O
only O
problem O
is O
that O
the O
manager O
is O
a O
complete O
incompetent O
. O

This O
place O
is O
charming O
and O
relaxing O
. O

My O
friends O
spoke O
so O
much O
about O
it O
for O
months O
, O
I O
finally O
made O
the O
time O
to O
come O
down O
ear O
and O
dine O
in O
. O

Well O
worth O
it O

Prices O
too O
high O
for O
this O
cramped O
and O
unappealing O
resturant O
. O

The O
food O
here O
does O
a O
great O
service O
to O
the O
name O
( O
Cantonese O
that O
is O
... O
) O
. O

This O
place O
rocks O
! O
! O

Yakitori O
( O
bbq O
meats O
) O
is O
tasty O
too O
. O

Parking O
is O
reasonably O
good O
, O
they O
have O
their O
own O
lot O
and O
you O
can O
park O
in O
the O
park O
nearby O
. O

I O
had O
fish O
and O
my O
husband O
had O
the O
filet O
- O
both O
of O
which O
exceeded O
our O
expectations O
. O

Appetizers O
took O
nearly O
an O
hour O
. O

Can O
get O
busy O
on O
Fridays O
for O
a O
table O
but O
once O
seated O
, O
the O
service O
is O
so O
efficient O
you O
can O
be O
in O
and O
out O
of O
there O
quickly O
. O

To O
sum O
it O
up O
: O
Service O
varies O
from O
good O
to O
mediorce O
, O
depending O
on O
which O
waiter O
you O
get O
; O
generally O
it O
is O
just O
average O
Ok O
. O

It O
is O
simply O
amazing O
. O

So O
close O
, O
but O
not O
good O
enough O
. O

My O
son O
and O
his O
girlfriend O
both O
wanted O
cheeseburgers O
and O
they O
were O
huge O
! O

I O
had O
the O
Thai O
style O
Fried O
Sea O
Bass O
... O
which O
was O
very O
good O
. O

– O
My O
first O
time O
to O
dine O
at O
this O
restaurant O
was O
with O
my O
son O
and O
it O
was O
absolutely O
horrible O
! O

I O
am O
happy O
i O
did O
the O
food O
was O
awsome O
. O

Their O
pad O
penang O
is O
delicious O
and O
everything O
else O
is O
fantastic O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
to O
anyone O
to O
give O
this O
place O
a O
try O
. O

Logic O
behind O
that O
? O

Best O
. O
Sushi O
. O
Ever O
. O

It O
doesn't O
look O
appetizing O
as O
it's O
covered O
in O
squid O
ink O
and O
it O
turns O
your O
lips O
and O
teeth O
black O
, O
but O
the O
taste O
was O
phenomenal O
. O

The O
farro O
salad O
and O
the O
mashed O
yukon O
potatoes O
were O
also O
extremely O
tasty O
. O

Go O
to O
son O
cubano O
in O
edgewater O
nj O
instead O
. O

Really O
, O
I O
find O
it O
rather O
scandalous O
that O
such O
a O
crappy O
restaurant O
attracts O
such O
crowds--this O
, O
in O
the O
city O
of O
a O
million O
restaurants O
, O
at O
least O
9/10 O
of O
which O
are O
way O
better O
than O
this O
one O
. O

– O
How O
to O
describe O
the O
best O
sushi O
in O
NYC O
: O
hmmmm O
, O
delicious O
, O
amazing O
, O
fantastic O
, O
suculent O
, O
perfect O
, O
nah O
, O
all O
of O
the O
above O
. O

Considering O
we O
were O
the O
last O
patrons O
there O
and O
it O
was O
after O
the O
closing O
time O
, O
the O
waitstaff O
did O
not O
rush O
us O
at O
all O
and O
made O
us O
feel O
comfortable O
and O
relaxed O
. O

– O
This O
was O
great O
dining O
experience O
. O

This O
is O
the O
case O
at O
this O
gem O
. O

The O
Prix O
Fixe O
menu O
is O
worth O
every O
penny O
and O
you O
get O
more O
than O
enough O
( O
both O
in O
quantity O
AND O
quality O
) O
. O

Just O
remember O
to O
dress O
a O
little O
urban-chic O
so O
you O
don O
? O
t O
look O
too O
far O
out O
of O
place O
. O

The O
service O
is O
good O
and O
the O
resturant O
is O
clean O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
moderately O
enjoyed O
was O
their O
Grilled O
Chicken O
special O
with O
Edamame O
Puree O
. O

Highly O
recommend O
it O
! O

A O
friend O
from O
Seattle O
and O
I O
went O
on O
a O
Thursday O
night O
around O
8: O
30 O
. O

From O
the O
spectacular O
caviar O
to O
the O
hospitable O
waitstaff O
, O
I O
felt O
like O
royalty O
and O
enjoyed O
every O
second O
of O
it O
. O

I O
had O
my O
eyes O
on O
this O
place O
, O
promising O
myself O
I O
will O
one O
day O
' O
give O
it O
a O
try O
. O
' O

The O
signs O
, O
the O
specials O
menus O
, O
food O
, O
and O
even O
all O
the O
waitstaff O
are O
ALL O
TOTALLY O
Japanese O
. O

And O
really O
large O
portions O
. O

We O
replied O
that O
we O
would O
like O
to O
wait O
5 O
more O
minutes O
if O
that O
was O
okay O
. O

I O
was O
there O
on O
sat O
. O
for O
my O
birthday O
and O
we O
had O
an O
excellent O
time O
. O

The O
pizza O
was O
pretty O
good O
and O
huge O
. O

best O
honey O
walnyt O
prawns O
that O
we O
have O
every O
tasted O
. O

The O
bar O
drinks O
were O
Eh O
, O
ok O
to O
say O
the O
least O
. O

I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
. O

Despite O
the O
confusing O
mirrors O
this O
will O
likely O
be O
my O
go-to O
for O
modern O
Japanese O
food O
for O
the O
foreseeable O
future O
. O

I've O
never O
had O
bad O
service O
and O
the O
fish O
is O
fresh O
and O
delicious O
. O

Would O
NEVER O
go O
back O

Best O
Indian O
Restaurant O
in O
the O
City O

I O
will O
be O
back O
! O

I O
think O
the O
pizza O
is O
so O
overrated O
and O
was O
under O
cooked O
. O

My O
friend O
from O
Milan O
and O
myself O
were O
pleasantly O
surprised O
when O
we O
arrived O
and O
everyone O
spoke O
italian O
. O

Even O
though O
its O
good O
seafood O
, O
the O
prices O
are O
too O
high O
. O

however O
, O
it's O
the O
service O
that O
leaves O
a O
bad O
taste O
in O
my O
mouth O
. O

First O
off O
, O
the O
food O
came O
fast O
and O
all O
together O
:) O
i O
like O
that O
... O
i O
hate O
the O
pretentiousness O
of O
things O
coming O
in O
one O
after O
the O
other O
. O

Great O
food O
with O
an O
awesome O
atmosphere O
! O

WHAT O
ELSE O
CAN O
YOU O
SAY O
NICE O
PEOPLE O
AMAZING O
FOOD O
WOW O

The O
restaurant O
is O
cute O
but O
not O
upscale O
. O

The O
service O
was O
poor O
, O
restaurant O
poorly O
lit O
, O
staff O
not O
very O
attentive O
and O
I O
would O
have O
rather O
eaten O
at O
a O
Mcdonald's O
than O
this O
joint O
. O

NOT O
THE O
PLACE O
IT O
ONCE O
WAS O

It O
was O
romantic O
- O
and O
even O
nice O
even O
with O
my O
sister O
, O
reminded O
me O
of O
Italy O
, O
and O
had O
artwork O
and O
music O
that O
kept O
up O
the O
feeling O
of O
being O
in O
a O
Mediterrean O
villa O
. O

The O
price O
very O
reasonable O
. O

Best O
Neighborhood O
Standby O
. O

Our O
waitress O
wasn't O
mean O
, O
but O
not O
especially O
warm O
or O
attentive O
either O
. O

Enjoyed O
a O
very O
nice O
Caesar O
Salad O
while O
my O
wife O
had O
arugula O
and O
goat O
cheese O
... O
both O
very O
tasty O
. O

Drawbacks O
: O
service O
is O
slow O
and O
they O
don't O
toast O
! O

After O
really O
enjoying O
ourselves O
at O
the O
bar O
we O
sat O
down O
at O
a O
table O
and O
had O
dinner O
. O

One O
special O
roll O
and O
one O
regular O
roll O
is O
enough O
to O
fill O
you O
up O
, O
but O
save O
room O
for O
dessert O
! O

the O
waitstaffs O
are O
nice O
though O
. O

We O
left O
without O
ever O
getting O
service O
. O

I O
have O
eaten O
a O
lot O
of O
pizza O
here O
. O

Thank O
you O
everyone O
at O
Water's O
Edge O
. O

In O
the O
summer O
months O
, O
the O
back O
garden O
area O
is O
really O
nice O
. O

This O
is O
some O
really O
good O
, O
inexpensive O
sushi O
. O

There O
are O
so O
many O
other O
great O
places O
to O
go O
to O
eat O
and O
drink O
... O
this O
place O
is O
not O
worth O
it O
... O

The O
sashimi O
is O
always O
fresh O
and O
the O
rolls O
are O
innovative O
and O
delicious O
. O

The O
prior O
reviews O
said O
Kid O
friendly O
... O
give O
me O
a O
break O
with O
two O
young O
children O
that O
is O
light O
years O
. O

The O
chicken O
lollipop O
is O
my O
favorite O
, O
most O
of O
the O
dishes O
( O
I O
have O
to O
agree O
with O
a O
previous O
reviewer O
) O
are O
quite O
oily O
and O
very O
spicy O
, O
espeically O
the O
Chilli O
Chicken O
. O

I O
have O
been O
coming O
here O
for O
years O
and O
have O
nothing O
but O
good O
things O
to O
say O
about O
the O
service O
and O
the O
great O
staff O
at O
La O
Lanterna O
. O

Ive O
asked O
a O
cart O
attendant O
for O
a O
lotus O
leaf O
wrapped O
rice O
and O
she O
replied O
back O
rice O
and O
just O
walked O
away O
. O

Try O
the O
Pad O
Thai O
, O
it's O
fabulous O
and O
their O
prices O
are O
so O
cheap O
! O

Our O
food O
was O
great O
too O
! O

NO O
PIZZA O
33 O
for O
me O
! O

Sometimes O
tables O
don't O
understand O
his O
sense O
of O
humor O
but O
it's O
refreshing O
to O
have O
a O
server O
who O
has O
personality O
, O
professionalism O
, O
and O
respects O
the O
privacy O
of O
your O
dinner O
. O

I O
honestly O
don't O
even O
know O
where O
to O
begin O
. O

Everyone O
raved O
about O
the O
atmosphere O
( O
elegant O
rooms O
and O
absolutely O
incomparable O
views O
) O
and O
the O
fabulous O
food O
! O

A O
beautifully O
designed O
dreamy O
Egyptian O
restaurant O
that O
gets O
sceney O
at O
night O
. O

I've O
never O
ordered O
anything O
else O
from O
their O
menu O
... O
there's O
no O
need O
to O
. O

I've O
lived O
in O
NY O
for O
5 O
years O
and O
this O
place O
has O
it O
all O
. O

The O
restaurant O
has O
a O
Family O
feel O
, O
not O
least O
with O
regard O
to O
the O
portions O
which O
are O
enormous O
; O
the O
veal O
alone O
could O
have O
single-handedly O
solved O
third O
world O
famine O
. O

Always O
good O
drinks O
and O
service O
is O
pretty O
good O
; O

They're O
are O
better O
Taiwanese O
restaurants O
and O
they O
are O
located O
in O
Flushing O
, O
Queens O
. O

Here O
the O
hot O
dog O
is O
elevated O
to O
the O
level O
of O
a O
real O
entree O
with O
numerous O
variations O
available O
. O

It O
was O
worth O
the O
wait O
. O

We O
’ O
re O
can O
’ O
t O
say O
enough O
about O
their O
delicious O
gourmet O
pizza O
’ O
s O
! O

It's O
popular O
w O
/ O
the O
late O
crowd O
. O

We O
were O
quickly O
seated O
and O
requested O
the O
special O
dinner O
, O
which O
came O
with O
: O
1 O
) O
Shellfish O
and O
Shrimp O
appetizer O
or O
Caesar O
Salad O
, O
2 O
) O
9 O
oz O
steak O
( O
with O
a O
single O
potato O
chip O
) O
, O
and O
3 O
) O
homemade O
donut O
holes O
. O

for O
7 O
years O
they O
have O
put O
out O
the O
most O
tasty O
, O
most O
delicious O
food O
and O
kept O
it O
that O
way O
... O

This O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
comfort O
food O
places O
in O
the O
city O
. O

I O
paid O
just O
about O
$ O
60 O
for O
a O
good O
meal O
, O
though O
:) O

We O
even O
had O
a O
visit O
from O
the O
Manager O
who O
wanted O
to O
make O
sure O
we O
were O
enjoying O
ourselves O
. O

Go O
to O
Volare O
for O
1st O
class O
service O
and O
terrific O
food O
. O

The O
dining O
room O
is O
quietly O
elegant O
with O
no O
music O
to O
shout O
over O
- O
- O
how O
refreshing O
! O

The O
atmosphere O
is O
aspiring O
, O
and O
the O
decor O
is O
festive O
and O
amazing O
.. O

I O
can O
highly O
recommend O
their O
various O
saag O
and O
paneer O
and O
korma O
. O

The O
staff O
is O
incredibly O
helpful O
and O
attentive O
. O

The O
food O
was O
pretty O
tradional O
but O
it O
was O
hot O
and O
good O
with O
large O
portions O
. O

Traditional O
French O
decour O
was O
pleasant O
though O
the O
hall O
was O
rather O
noisy O
- O
the O
restaurant O
was O
full O
and O
we O
had O
to O
raise O
our O
voices O
to O
be O
able O
to O
maintain O
a O
conversation O
. O

The O
fish O
was O
really O
, O
really O
fresh O
. O

The O
price O
is O
reasonable O
although O
the O
service O
is O
poor O
. O

Decor O
is O
charming O
. O

Just O
not O
good O
at O
all O
. O

I O
go O
and O
eat O
out O
at O
many O
different O
restaurants O
and O
this O
is O
one O
place O
you O
have O
go O
and O
try O
. O

Don't O
be O
fooled O
by O
crowds O
of O
people O
. O

IT O
WAS O
HORRIBLE O
. O

We O
, O
there O
were O
four O
of O
us O
, O
arrived O
at O
noon O
- O
the O
place O
was O
empty O
- O
and O
the O
staff O
acted O
like O
we O
were O
imposing O
on O
them O
and O
they O
were O
very O
rude O
. O

Very O
, O
very O
nice O

The O
waitress O
moved O
our O
table O
practically O
into O
the O
bathroom O
and O
when O
we O
asked O
to O
cancel O
our O
dinner O
orders O
because O
we O
did O
not O
want O
to O
eat O
sitting O
on O
the O
toilet O
, O
we O
were O
told O
no O
... O

not O
only O
is O
the O
food O

I'm O
a O
friendly O
person O
, O
so O
I O
wouldn't O
mind O
had O
she O
not O
been O
so O
nasty O
and O
gotten O
so O
personal O
. O

This O
is O
sad O
for O
what O
once O
was O
one O
of O
the O
best O
places O
you O
could O
ever O
eat O
. O

We O
will O
definitely O
go O
back O
. O

but O
the O
service O
was O
a O
bit O
slow O
. O

The O
manager O
came O
to O
the O
table O
and O
said O
we O
can O
do O
what O
we O
want O
, O
so O
we O
paid O
for O
what O
we O
did O
enjoy O
, O
the O
drinks O
and O
appetizers O
, O
and O
walked O
out O
. O

They O
pay O
such O
detail O
to O
everything O
from O
miso O
soup O
to O
complex O
rolls O
. O

Late O
night O
dinning O
with O
exeptional O
food O
. O

What O
we O
did O
do O
was O
waste O
3 O
hours O
being O
trapped O
in O
a O
table O
waiting O
and O
waiting O
for O
food O
and O
drinks O
and O
hooka O
.. O
some O
of O
which O
we O
never O
received O
! O

Patroon O
features O
a O
nice O
cigar O
bar O
and O
has O
great O
staff O
. O

I O
came O
here O
for O
my O
friend's O
birthday O
and O
keep O
coming O
back O
ever O
since O
. O

Ive O
been O
to O
many O
Thai O
restaurants O
in O
Manhattan O
before O
, O
and O
Toons O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
Thai O
food O
Ive O
had O
( O
except O
for O
my O
mom's O
of O
course O
) O
. O

Consequently O
, O
their O
burgers O
fell O
apart O
in O
their O
hands O
and O
made O
such O
a O
mess O
that O
they O
did'nt O
feel O
like O
finishing O
them O
. O

However O
, O
go O
for O
the O
ambience O
, O
and O
consider O
the O
food O
just O
a O
companion O
for O
a O
trip O
across O
the O
world O
! O

It O
is O
nearly O
impossible O
to O
get O
a O
table O
, O
so O
if O
you O
ever O
have O
the O
chance O
to O
go O
here O
for O
dinner O
, O
DO O
NOT O
pass O
it O
up O
. O

Growing O
up O
in O
NY O
, O
I O
have O
eaten O
my O
share O
of O
bagels O
. O

Noodle O
pudding O
is O
exactly O
the O
type O
of O
service O
and O
food O
I O
enjoy O
. O

This O
small O
Astoria O
souvlaki O
spot O
makes O
what O
many O
consider O
the O
best O
gyros O
in O
New O
York O
. O

Only O
drawback O
- O
they O
won't O
toast O
your O
bagel O
, O
and O
they O
don't O
make O
eggs O
for O
the O
bagel O
. O

Also O
, O
because O
it O
is O
so O
thin O
, O
it O
gets O
cold O
very O
quickly O
and O
its O
not O
that O
filling O
. O

Price O
no O
more O
than O
a O
Jersey O
deli O
but O
way O
better O
. O

Nice O
food O
but O
no O
spice O
! O

I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
it O
. O

La O
Rosa O
waltzes O
in O
, O
and O
I O
think O
they O
are O
doing O
it O
the O
best O
. O

Entrees O
: O
Vanison O
steak O
and O
Bison O
Steak O
. O

While O
I O
could O
have O
done O
without O
the O
youth O
who O
shared O
the O
evening O
with O
us O
, O
our O
wonderful O
server O
and O
food O
made O
the O
experience O
a O
very O
positive O
one O
. O

10 O
! O

I O
should O
have O
thought O
to O
bring O
it O
up O
but O
never O
expected O
the O
food O
to O
be O
that O
mild O
. O

I O
have O
been O
to O
this O
place O
, O
folks O
and O
it O
is O
BAD O
. O

You O
fellas O
above O
says O
its O
the O
best O
Taiwanese O
restaurant O
in O
town O
. O

Our O
friends O
have O
not O
arrived O
yet O
. O

Its O
great O
if O
you O
spent O
the O
day O
there O
and O
didn't O
want O
to O
drive O
to O
eat O
. O

It O
’ O
s O
just O
you O
and O
your O
date O
and O
an O
occasional O
cute O
‘ O
excuse O
me O
’ O
before O
the O
waiter O
opens O
the O
little O
curtain O
to O
your O
booth O
! O

The O
nakgi-bokum O
was O
horrible O
. O

Service O
was O
wonderful O
; O

Green O
Tea O
creme O
brulee O
is O
a O
must O
! O

In O
fact O
there O
is O
only O
one O
I've O
tried O
that O
even O
compares O
( O
shabu O
Tatsu O
) O
and O
even O
then O
I O
prefer O
Dokebi O
. O

It's O
a O
great O
place O
to O
people O
watch O
. O

Bison O
was O
quite O
excellent O
however O
. O

The O
takeout O
is O
great O
too O
since O
they O
give O
high O
quality O
tupperware O
as O
well O
. O

Fancy O
pieces O
of O
exotic O
fish O
on O
a O
$ O
100 O
dollar O
plate O
and O
NOT O
ONE O
was O
eatable O
. O

Prefer O
to O
order O
it O
and O
pick O
it O
up O
though O
because O
I O
don't O
like O
the O
servers O
, O
one O
young O
woman O
in O
particular O
. O

I'd O
be O
horrified O
if O
my O
staff O
were O
turning O
away O
customers O
so O
early O
and O
so O
rudely O
! O

Best O
Indian O
food O
in O
L O
. O
A O
. O

You O
must O
try O
the O
shrimp O
appetizers O
. O

We O
waited O
for O
an O
hour O
to O
be O
seated O
. O

I O
would O
not O
expect O
this O
for O
a O
$ O
55 O
dinner O
. O

They O
have O
it O
all O
- O
- O
great O
price O
, O
food O
, O
and O
service O
. O

I O
recommend O
getting O
a O
reservation O
even O
though O
we O
saw O
people O
seated O
without O
one O
. O

Dungeness O
crabs O
here O
! O

I O
have O
been O
going O
back O
again O
and O
again O
. O

Food O
is O
great O
. O

My O
boyfriend O
had O
Prime O
Rib O
it O
was O
good O
. O

The O
lobster O
knuckles O
( O
special O
of O
the O
day O
) O
were O
ok O
, O
but O
pretty O
tasteless O
. O

The O
restaurant O
offers O
an O
extensive O
wine O
list O
and O
an O
ambiance O
you O
won't O
forget O
! O

Not O
because O
you O
are O
" O
The O
Four O
Seasons O
" O
... O
– O
you O
are O
allowed O
to O
charge O
an O
arm O
and O
a O
leg O
for O
a O
romatic O
dinner O
. O

Old O
school O
meets O
New O
world O
. O

We O
didn't O
look O
like O
the O
other O
patrons O
in O
there O
so O
unfortunately O
I O
think O
that O
may O
have O
been O
part O
of O
the O
problem O
. O

Service O
not O
the O
friendliest O
to O
our O
" O
large O
party O
" O
! O

When O
you're O
sitting O
in O
their O

room O
( O
which O
has O
a O
spectacular O
, O
hand-painted O
high O

you'd O
never O

earlier O
this O
week O
and O
have O
not O
stopped O
ranting O
and O
raving O
about O
the O
food O
. O

Food O
was O
very O
good O
as O
well O
, O
considering O
that O
we O
tried O
the O
budget O
selection O
( O
though O
I O
wish O
the O
pork O
belly O
that O
I O
ordered O
was O
roasted O
a O
bit O
longer O
, O
so O
that O
fat O
was O
more O
of O
a O
melt-in-your-mouth O
experience O
) O
. O

Pizza O
was O
a O
little O
soggy O
. O

Snotty O
Attitude O

WAY O
OVER-RATED O
! O
! O
! O

We O
ate O
out O
in O
the O
back O
patio O
, O
which O
is O
worth O
it O
as O
it's O
cool O
and O
the O
music O
is O
hear O
well O
there O
. O

I've O
been O
to O
this O
restaurant O
over O
a O
dozen O
times O
with O
no O
complaints O
to O
date O
. O

The O
manager O
finally O
said O
he O
would O
comp O
the O
two O
glasses O
of O
wine O
( O
which O
cost O
less O
than O
the O
food O
) O
, O
and O
made O
it O
seem O
like O
a O
big O
concession O
. O

This O
tiny O
restaurant O
is O
as O
cozy O
as O
it O
gets O
, O
with O
that O
certain O
Parisian O
flair O
. O

Thius O
is O
a O
must O
for O
anyone O
who O
loves O
Shabu-Shabu O
. O

The O
wine O
list O
was O
extensive O
- O
though O
the O
staff O
did O
not O
seem O
knowledgeable O
about O
wine O
pairings O
. O

The O
pizza O
was O
great O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
Cafe O
St O
. O
Bart's O
for O
their O
food O
, O
the O
ambience O
and O
wonderful O
service O
. O

The O
menu O
has O
so O
many O
fish O
items O
and O
oysters O
. O

If O
you O
go O
here O
, O
do O
it O
on O
his O
off-night O
. O

Leon O
is O
an O
East O
Village O
gem O
: O
casual O
but O
hip O
, O
with O
well O
prepared O
basic O
French O
bistro O
fare O
, O
good O
specials O
, O
a O
warm O
and O
lively O
atmosphere O
. O

– O
I O
loved O
the O
pumpkin O
ravioli O
and O
the O
goat O
cheese O
gnocchi O
( O
5 O
big O
ones O
to O
a O
plate O
instead O
of O
20 O
or O
so O
little O
gnocchis O
) O
and O
my O
sister O
loved O
her O
filet O
mignon O
on O
top O
of O
spinach O
and O
mashed O
potatoes O
. O

Make O
sure O
you O
try O
this O
place O
as O
often O
as O
you O
can O
. O

I O
mentioned O
the O
squid O
dish O
wasn't O
very O
good O
when O
the O
waitress O
visited O
. O

The O
staff O
there O
is O
very O
attentive O
and O
down O
to O
earth O
. O

While O
the O
ambiance O
and O
atmosphere O
were O
great O
, O
the O
food O
and O
service O
could O
have O
been O
a O
lot O
better O
. O

Absolutely O
delicious O
. O

There's O
another O
girl O
who O
I O
can't O
describe O
, O
she O
is O
about O
5 O
' O
6 O
" O
with O
brown O
hair O
, O
who O
eavesdrops O
on O
your O
conversation O
and O
chimes O
in O
- O
except O
she O
only O
hears O
the O
last O
part O
of O
what O
you O
said O
, O
so O
her O
uninvited O
opinions O
are O
often O
out O
of O
context O
and O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
what O
you're O
* O
really O
* O
talking O
about O
. O

Service O
is O
top O
notch O
. O

Untill O
this O
happens O
, O
my O
advice O
is O
to O
STAY O
AWAY O
. O

believe O
us O
, O
we've O
been O
eating O
sushi O
for O
over O
15 O
yrs O
. O

The O
only O
drawback O
is O
the O
crowded O
seating O
and O
the O
slow O
service O
. O

Immediately O
after O
we O
paid O
, O
the O
waiter O
took O
the O
money O
and O
said O
, O
okay O
, O
you O
guys O
are O
outta O
here O
. O

Also O
very O
inexpensive O
. O

Everything O
is O
always O
cooked O
to O
perfection O
, O
the O
service O
is O
excellent O
, O
the O
decor O
cool O
and O
understated O
. O

The O
food O
was O
ok O
, O
but O
the O
service O
was O
so O
poor O
that O
the O
food O
was O
cold O
buy O
the O
time O
everyone O
in O
my O
party O
was O
served O
. O

The O
atmosphere O
is O
unheralded O
, O
the O
service O
impecible O
, O
and O
the O
food O
magnificant O
. O

Be O
aware O
. O

The O
waiters O
are O
very O
experienced O
and O
helpful O
with O
pairing O
your O
drink O
choice O
to O
your O
food O
tastes O
or O
vice O
versa O
. O

This O
place O
... O
god O
where O
do O
i O
begin O
. O

The O
food O
was O
all O
good O
but O
it O
was O
way O
too O
mild O
. O

We O
had O
half O
/ O
half O
pizza O
, O
mine O
was O
eggplant O
and O
my O
friend O
had O
the O
buffalo O
and O
it O
was O
sooo O
huge O
for O
a O
small O
size O
pizza O
! O

I O
wanted O
to O
go O
there O
to O
see O
if O
it O
was O
worth O
it O
and O
sadly O
, O
curiousity O
got O
the O
best O
of O
me O
and O
I O
paid O
dearly O
for O
it O
. O

The O
best O
place O
for O
a O
leisure O
Sunday O
breakfast O
amidst O
yachts O
, O
then O
take O
a O
stroll O
through O
the O
nearby O
Farmer's O
Market O
. O

Coming O
from O
Boston O
this O
place O
is O
like O
Emma's O
Pizza O
in O
Kendall O
Square O
in O
Cambridge O
( O
although O
they O
have O
more O
funky O
toppings O
! O
) O

My O
girlfriend O
, O
being O
slightly O
more O
aggressive O
, O
and O
having O
been O
equally O
disgusted O
causing O
her O
to O
throw O
out O
the O
remainder O
of O
her O
barely O
eaten O
meal O
, O
called O
back O
only O
to O
be O
informed O
that O
I O
was O
probably O
wrong O
and O
that O
it O
was O
most O
likely O
an O
oyster O
, O
and O
that O
we O
were O
also O
blacklisted O
from O
their O
restaurant O
. O

The O
bibimbap O
was O
average O
, O
but O
the O
stone O
bowl O
wasn't O
even O
close O
to O
sizzling O
. O

For O
all O
you O
lazy O
folks O
that O
don't O
want O
to O
come O
to O
Alphabet O
City O
, O
I O
say O
, O
good O
- O
stay O
out O
. O

The O
best O
calamari O
in O
Seattle O
! O

Drinks O
: O
2 O
glasses O
of O
Dom O
Perignon O
at O
$ O
35 O
each O
. O

Problem O
is O
nothing O
at O
Prune O
is O
particularly O
memorable O
. O

quacamole O
at O
pacifico O
is O
yummy O
, O
as O
are O
the O
wings O
with O
chimmichuri O
. O

I O
must O
give O
it O
Yon O
out O
of O
Yon O
stars O
! O

To O
top O
it O
all O
off O
.. O
the O
main O
reason O
we O
came O
to O
your O
restaurant O
was O
for O
the O
belly O
dancers O
and O
missed O
the O
first O
show O
as O
we O
were O
not O
seated O
yet O
and O
the O
2nd O
belly O
dancer O
only O
danced O
at O
two O
tables O
in O
the O
back O
of O
the O
restaurant O
and O
never O
made O
it O
around O
to O
the O
other O
half O
of O
the O
restaurant O
. O

The O
veal O
and O
the O
mushrooms O
were O
cooked O
perfectly O
. O

Decent O
wine O
at O
reasonable O
prices O
. O

I O
will O
definetly O
be O
going O
back O
. O

I O
was O
wrong O
. O

I O
got O
the O
$ O
10 O
10 O
- O
piece O
dim O
sum O
combo O
, O
every O
bite O
of O
which O
was O
great O
. O

Have O
gone O
to O
all O
the O
top O
places O
. O

I O
took O
one O
bite O
from O
the O
$ O
24 O
salmon O
, O
and O
I O
have O
never O
, O
in O
the O
17 O
years O
I O
have O
been O
going O
to O
restaurants O
tasted O
salmon O
as O
fishy O
, O
as O
dry O
, O
and O
as O
bland O
as O
the O
one O
in O
Flatbush O
Farms O
. O

After O
we O
ate O
our O
appetizers O
( O
which O
took O
all O
of O
8 O
minutes O
) O
we O
ordered O
another O
round O
of O
Brahma's O
- O
and O
tried O
to O
stall O
a O
little O
as O
we O
waited O
for O
our O
sixth O
dinner O
member O
. O

the O
brocollis O
were O
so O
fresh O
and O
tasty O
. O

Indoor O
ambience O
was O
modern O
. O

We O
didn't O
want O
a O
bottle O
of O
bubbly O
on O
a O
weekday O
so O
we O
each O
got O
little O
bottles O
of O
Korbett O
it O
was O
just O
enough O
. O

– O
I O
was O
highly O
disappointed O
in O
the O
food O
at O
Pagoda O
. O

There O
is O
no O
way O
it O
justifies O
the O
accolades O
it O
receives O
, O
the O
attitude O
of O
the O
staff O
or O
the O
wait O
for O
a O
table O
. O

On O
a O
recent O
Sunday O
afternoon O
, O
a O
friend O
and O
I O
accidently O
found O
this O
great O
restaurant O
on O
our O
way O
to O
see O
the O
pulitzer O
prize O
winning O
play O
DOUBT O
. O

It's O
unpretentious O
and O
underground O
. O

Finally O
a O
reliable O
Chinese O
restaurant O
! O

Always O
a O
nice O
crowd O
, O
but O
never O
loud O
. O

A O
coworker O
and O
I O
tried O
Pacifico O
after O
work O
a O
few O
Fridays O
and O
loved O
it O
. O

I O
would O
go O
back O
for O
the O
wine O
experience O
alone O
. O

And O
they O
give O
good O
quantity O
for O
the O
price O
. O

It O
was O
totally O
overpriced O
- O
fish O
and O
chips O
was O
about O
$ O
15 O
... O

too O
large O
for O
just O
two O
people O
but O
nothing O
was O
left O
. O

The O
spicy O
tuna O
roll O
was O
unusually O
good O
and O
the O
rock O
shrimp O
tempura O
was O
awesome O
, O
great O
appetizer O
to O
share O
! O

I've O
waited O
over O
one O
hour O
for O
food O
. O

The O
food O
is O
reliable O
and O
the O
price O
is O
moderate O
. O

– O
Went O
there O
last O
night O
with O
a O
friend O
. O

The O
menu O
consisted O
of O
standard O
brassiere O
food O
, O
better O
then O
places O
like O
Balthazar O
etc O
. O

But O
nonetheless--great O
spot O
, O
great O
food O
. O

The O
pasta O
was O
well O
cooked O
, O
didn't O
have O
enough O
sauce O
though O
or O
flavor O
. O

Skip O
this O
restaurant O
, O
it's O
a O
big O
disappointment O
. O

Very O
cozy O
and O
warm O
inside O
... O

Great O
food O
, O
amazing O
service O
, O
this O
place O
is O
a O
class O
act O
. O

As O
always O
we O
had O
a O
great O
glass O
of O
wine O
while O
we O
waited O
. O

Rather O
than O
eating O
the O
meat O
entree O
being O
offered O
, O
I O
requested O
a O
vegetarian O
dish O
. O

For O
dinner O
I O
had O
the O
chicken O
tikka-masala O
and O
some O
garlic O
naan O
. O

Everyone O
was O
smiling O
so O
that O
made O
me O
feel O
welcome O
. O

When O
the O
bill O
came O
, O
he O
only O
took O
the O
discount O
off O
the O
food O
and O
not O
the O
drinks O
. O

Mama O
Mia O
– O
I O
live O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
and O
feel O
lucky O
to O
live O
by O
such O
a O
great O
pizza O
place O
. O

Amazing O
Spanish O
Mackeral O
special O
appetizer O
and O
perfect O
box O
sushi O
( O
that O
eel O
with O
avodcao O
- O
- O
um O
um O
um O
) O
. O

I O
just O
read O
Mocaramel's O
review O
and O
felt O
compelled O
to O
respond O
. O

Food O
was O
good O
and O
appetizing O
. O

As O
it O
turns O
out O
the O
owner O
was O
seated O
right O
next O
to O
us O
and O
when O
he O
came O
over O
to O
check O
on O
our O
problems O
was O
very O
dismissive O
and O
offered O
a O
token O
20 O
% O
discount O
on O
our O
bill O
. O

Keep O
up O
the O
good O
work O
guys O
! O

Great O
pizza O
for O
lunch O
place O
. O

Excellent O
dumplings O
served O
amid O
clean O
, O
chic O
decor O
. O

Food O
was O
okay O
, O
nothing O
great O
. O

We O
were O
worried O
we O
would O
have O
trouble O
getting O
in O
, O
but O
somehow O
managed O
to O
have O
a O
short O
wait O
. O

– O
This O
place O
is O
unbelievably O
over-rated O
. O

Everything O
was O
going O
good O
until O
we O
got O
our O
meals O
. O

The O
counter O
service O
is O
bad O
. O

Anyways O
, O
if O
you're O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
to O
eat O
good O
food O
, O
I O
wouldn't O
waste O
my O
time O
trying O
to O
find O
something O
, O
rather O
go O
across O
the O
street O
to O
Tamari O
. O

We O
have O
been O
to O
this O
place O
many O
times O
, O
and O
always O
have O
great O
food O
, O
wine O
, O
and O
service O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
many O
want O
to O
return O
a O
second O
time O
during O
their O
visit O
. O

Fish O
was O
overdone O
. O

not O
too O
fine O
thought O
that O
you O
feel O
uncomfortable O
and O
have O
to O
dress O
up O
. O

We O
had O
the O
lobster O
sandwich O
and O
it O
was O
FANTASTIC O
. O

For O
those O
of O
you O
who O
don't O
know O
, O
Uni O
is O
Sea O
Urchin O
in O
Japanese O
, O
which O
happens O
to O
be O
my O
favorite O
. O
) O

– O
I O
can't O
say O
enough O
about O
this O
place O
. O

Big O
Wong O
is O
a O
great O
place O
to O
eat O
and O
fill O
your O
stomach O
. O

Personal O
pans O
are O
the O
perfect O
size O
for O
those O
hungry O
nights O
. O

Whenever O
you O
need O
a O
Sushi O
fix O
, O
Mizu O
will O
be O
there O
with O
quality O
fish O
and O
great O
service O
. O

I O
recommend O
the O
jelly O
fish O
, O
drunken O
chicken O
and O
the O
soupy O
dumplings O
, O
certainly O
the O
stir O
fry O
blue O
crab O
. O

For O
me O
dishes O
a O
little O
oily O
, O
but O
overall O
dining O
experience O
good O
. O

I O
wasn't O
here O
for O
the O
pizza O
so O
I O
can't O
comment O
on O
that O
yet O
but O
what O
I O
had O
was O
very O
good O
. O

Her O
sister O
had O
the O
baklava O
for O
dessert O
! O

The O
design O
of O
the O
space O
is O
good O
. O

but O
when O
we O
looked O
at O
the O
menu O
, O
there O
weren't O
a O
lot O
of O
choices O
, O
most O
of O
them O
were O
dumplings O
in O
the O
appetizer O
section O
. O

The O
scallion O
pancakes O
and O
fried O
dumplings O
were O
nothing O
out O
of O
the O
ordinary O
. O

I'm O
going O
back O
. O

What O
more O
can O
you O
ask O
for O
? O

good O
sake O
selection O
. O

This O
place O
is O
pricey O
, O
and O
yes O
, O
the O
food O
is O
worth O
it O
; O
but O
the O
service O
makes O
you O
feel O
like O
you O
should O
be O
paying O
a O
quater O
of O
the O
price O
. O

Thalia O
is O
a O
beautiful O
restaurant O
with O
beautiful O
people O
serving O
you O
, O
but O
the O
food O
doesn't O
quite O
match O
up O
. O

They O
smell O
like O
they O
stuff O
them O
with O
old O
canned O
vegetables O
like O
the O
spinach O
mushroom O
calzone O
. O

THe O
Pizza O
and O
wine O
were O
excellent-the O
service O
too--but O
what O
really O
MADE O
this O
place O
was O
the O
backyard O
dining O
area O
. O

Great O
Pizza O
, O
Poor O
Service O

It's O
a O
great O
place O
to O
order O
from O
or O
sit-in O
. O

THe O
perfect O
spot O
. O

Good O
food O
: O
my O
favorite O
is O
the O
seafood O
spaghetti O
. O

I O
asked O
for O
a O
menu O
and O
the O
same O
waitress O
looked O
at O
my O
like O
I O
was O
insane O
. O

They O
even O
scoop O
it O
out O
nice O
( O
for O
those O
on O
a O
diet O
) O
not O
too O
much O
not O
to O
little O
. O

The O
regular O
menu O
here O
is O
slightly O
above O
average O
that O
is O
not O
worth O
the O
snotty O
attitude O
that O
you O
receive O
. O

If O
you're O
going O
to O
see O
Danny O
Gans O
or O
just O
staying O
at O
the O
Mirage O
, O
don't O
miss O
this O
one O
. O

– O
My O
husband O
and O
I O
love O
eating O
at O
Mioposto O
Café O
. O

I O
was O
one O
of O
the O
people O
that O
went O
for O
this O
horrible O
experience O
. O

I O
went O
home O
& O
looked O
them O
up O
online O
again O
where O
I O
discovered O
there O
is O
a O
link O
for O
a O
give O
away O
that O
doesn't O
work O
so O
emailed O
the O
restaurant O
about O
the O
non O
existent O
service O
& O
deceptive O
link O
. O

Service O
was O
quick O
. O

I O
went O
there O
in O
late O
afternoon O
for O
some O
bite O
size O
food O
and O
refleshment O
with O
my O
date O
. O

Delivery O
is O
fast O
too O
. O

Excellent O
spot O
for O
holiday O
get O
togethers O
with O
co-workers O
or O
friends O
that O
you O
haven't O
seen O
in O
a O
while O
. O

Got O
a O
date O
? O
Go O
here O
! O

The O
service O
was O
attentive O
, O
yet O
unimposing O
, O
the O
food O
was O
far O
better O
than O
many O
notorious O
restaurants O
in O
Midtown O
and O
the O
wine O
list O
is O
extensive O
and O
well O
priced O
. O

On O
weekends O
, O
you O
might O
have O
to O
wait O
for O
couple O
hours O
. O

I O
will O
go O
back O
to O
Suan O
soon O
! O

All O
considered O
, O
I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
Ray's O
Boathouse O
is O
deserving O
of O
its O
title O
as O
a O
Seattle O
institution O
. O

Not O
a O
very O
fancy O
place O
but O
very O
good O
Chinese O
style O
Indian O
food O
. O

The O
food O
was O
exceptional O
. O

Restaurants O
in O
manhattan O
should O
try O
to O
model O
food O
and O
service O
after O
this O
place O
. O

I'm O
not O
even O
going O
to O
bother O
to O
describe O
it O
; O
it O
speaks O
for O
itself O
. O

Don't O
waste O
money O
on O
decor O
. O

Food O
was O
good O
and O
cheap O
. O

They O
are O
extremely O
rude O
, O
not O
even O
apologizing O
for O
the O
horrible O
service O
we O
got O
and O
handing O
us O
a O
bill O
well O
over O
$ O
500 O
for O
some O
drinks O
adn O
their O
pita O
bread O
! O

Overall O
, O
excellent O
restaurant O
! O

sometimes O
i O
get O
good O
food O
and O
ok O
service O
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
the O
food O
was O
great O
( O
except O
for O
the O
dessserts O
) O
. O

I O
loved O
this O
place O
! O
! O

Which O
of O
course O
is O
not O
real O
Kobe O
but O
Wagyu O
beef O
. O

Definitely O
has O
one O
of O
the O
best O
jukebox's O
i've O
seen O
in O
a O
long O
long O
time O
. O

The O
pancakes O
were O
certainly O
inventive O
but O
$ O
8.50 O
for O
3 O
- O
6 O
" O
pancakes O
( O
one O
of O
them O
was O
more O
like O
5 O
" O
) O
in O
the O
pancake O
flight O
( O
sample O
of O
3 O
different O
pancakes O
) O
is O
well O
over-priced O
. O

The O
pasta O
penne O
was O
pretty O
extra O
buttery O
, O
creamy O
which O
means O
a O
big O
task O
to O
diggest O
.. O
tasty O
at O
first O
but O
i O
would O
say O
that O
i O
was O
full O
with O
a O
slice O
of O
pizza O
and O
7 O
to O
count O
, O
penne O
... O
got O
a O
little O
moody O
afterwards O
cause O
was O
stuffed O
... O
lol O

He O
has O
visited O
Thailand O
and O
is O
quite O
expert O
on O
the O
cuisine O
. O

At O
$ O
120 O
for O
two O
people O
, O
however O
, O
this O
in O
no O
way O
represents O
value O
, O
unless O
you're O
looking O
to O
pay O
by O
the O
hour O
for O
passive-aggressive O
torture O
. O

However O
, O
once O
I O
received O
my O
predictably O
mediocre O
order O
of O
what O
Dokebi O
thinks O
passes O
as O
Korean O
fair O
, O
( O
sometimes O
you O
have O
to O
settle O
when O
it's O
your O
only O
option O
) O
, O
I O
got O
through O
about O
half O
my O
kimchee O
before O
I O
found O
a O
piece O
of O
random O
lettuce O
accompanied O
by O
a O
far O
more O
disgusting O
, O
slimy O
, O
clearly O
bad O
piece O
of O
fish O
skin O
. O

We O
were O
greeted O
promptly O
by O
the O
waiter O
who O
was O
very O
nice O
and O
cordial O
. O

I O
had O
a O
grat O
time O
at O
Jekyll O
and O
Hyde O
! O

If O
you O
are O
in O
the O
area O
try O
The O
Bagel O
Shoppe O
on O
74th O
street O
which O
is O
3 O
blocks O
away O
on O
2nd O
Ave O
. O

Good O
food O
! O

The O
open O
sesame O
combo O
plate O
is O
a O
bargain O
for O
the O
heap O
of O
food O
given O
. O

– O
Ray's O
is O
THE O
place O
to O
go O
for O
high O
quality O
seafood O
dinners O
. O

I O
had O
a O
huge O
group O
for O
my O
birthday O
and O
we O
were O
well O
taken O
care O
of O
. O

The O
space O
kind O
of O
feels O
like O
an O
Alice O
in O
Wonderland O
setting O
, O
without O
it O
trying O
to O
be O
that O
. O

Surprisingly O
nothing O
could O
be O
further O
from O
the O
truth O
. O

Molto O
bene O
! O

Best O
Taiwanese O
food O
in O
NY O
! O

Management O
should O
really O
take O
notice O
and O
train O
their O
waitstaff O
and O
teach O
them O
some O
proper O
manners O
. O

But O
Im O
sure O
this O
was O
just O
an O
honest O
mistake O
... O

For O
my O
entrée O
, O
I O
completely O
enjoyed O
the O
seared O
Alaskan O
sea O
scallops O
complemented O
by O
chard O
, O
artichoke O
hearts O
, O
fennel O
, O
and O
pecorino O
toscano O
. O

The O
atmosphere O
was O
just O
okay O
. O

first O
it O
took O
us O
a O
long O
time O
to O
find O
the O
place O
. O

A O
weakness O
is O
the O
chicken O
in O
the O
salads O
. O

Once O
for O
dinner O
and O
once O
for O
brunch O
. O

Unhygienic O

There O
have O
been O
several O
occasions O
when O
we've O
just O
not O
gotten O
some O
side O
dishes O
we've O
ordered O
. O

The O
food O
is O
very O
average O
... O
the O
Thai O
fusion O
stuff O
is O
a O
bit O
too O
sweet O
, O
every O
thing O
they O
serve O
is O
too O
sweet O
here O
. O

I O
lOVE O
THIS O
PLACE O
! O

Also O
, O
don't O
plan O
on O
asking O
for O
your O
favorite O
roll O
, O
if O
it's O
not O
on O
the O
menu O
, O
you O
can't O
have O
it O
. O

What O
a O
great O
place O
! O

so O
delicious O
! O
! O
! O

Doesn't O
get O
any O
better O
than O
that O
. O

When O
we O
sat O
, O
we O
got O
great O
and O
fast O
service O
. O

I O
live O
in O
the O
neightborhood O
and O
am O
a O
regular O
. O

skip O
dessert O
. O

I O
go O
out O
to O
eat O
and O
like O
my O
courses O
, O
servers O
are O
patient O
and O
never O
rush O
courses O
or O
force O
another O
drink O
. O

I O
almost O
hesititate O
to O
write O
a O
review O
because O
the O
atmosphere O
was O
so O
great O
and O
I O
would O
hate O
for O
it O
too O
become O
to O
crowded O
. O

Will O
definitely O
be O
back O
. O

The O
Four O
Seasons O
restaurant O
is O
a O
great O
experience O
. O

Without O
the O
wait O
or O
attitude O
, O
I O
would O
probably O
go O
back O
, O
but O
there O
are O
just O
too O
many O
other O
restaurants O
in O
Brooklyn O
that O
are O
as O
good O
or O
better O
and O
don't O
make O
me O
jump O
through O
hoops O
. O

Wish O
NY O
had O
more O
of O
these O
kind O
of O
places O
: O
intimate O
, O
superb O
food O
, O
homey O
, O
top O
notch O
all O
the O
way O
around O
, O
certainly O
worth O
the O
wait O
. O

We O
know O
the O
difference O
between O
and O
oyster O
and O
bad O
fish O
. O

Our O
first O
course O
was O
Tuna O
Sashimi O
with O
Green O
Yuzu O
Sauce O
. O

Get O
the O
pepperoni O
- O
YUM O
- O
and O
a O
family O
style O
salad O
. O

sometimes O
i O
get O
bad O
food O
and O
bad O
service O
, O
sometimes O
i O
get O
good O
good O
and O
bad O
service O
. O

The O
design O
and O
atmosphere O
is O
just O
as O
good O
. O

We'd O
go O
back O
again O

However O
, O
I O
think O
Jeckll O
and O
Hydes O
t O
is O
one O
of O
those O
places O
that O
is O
fun O
to O
do O
once O
. O

Everything O
you O
want O
and O
more O
, O
very O
fresh O
. O

The O
workers O
there O
also O
absolutely O
load O
the O
bagel O
with O
cream O
cheese O
( O
gets O
a O
little O
messy O
) O
. O

I O
had O
to O
ask O
her O
three O
times O
before O
she O
finally O
came O
back O
with O
the O
dish O
Ive O
requested O
. O

My O
chicken O
was O
inedible O
as O
there O
were O
so O
many O
fatty O
lumps O
which O
i O
had O
to O
keep O
spitting O
out O
into O
my O
napkin O
. O

We O
were O
seated O
outside O
and O
the O
waiter O
spilled O
red O
wine O
and O
hot O
tea O
on O
myself O
and O
my O
date O
. O

Out O
of O
the O
hundreds O
of O
Italian O
restaurants O
in O
Queens O
, O
this O
is O
among O
the O
best O
. O

fine O
dining O
restaurant O
quality O
. O

The O
food O
was O
good O
, O
the O
place O
was O
clean O
and O
affordable O
. O

If O
you O
want O
good O
authentic O
Thai O
this O
place O
is O
not O
the O
place O
to O
go O
. O

For O
authentic O
Thai O
food O
, O
look O
no O
further O
than O
Toons O
. O

The O
atmosphere O
was O
great O
. O

Waitstaff O
are O
very O
friendly O
. O

The O
side O
dishes O
were O
passable O
, O
and O
I O
did O
get O
a O
refill O
upon O
request O
. O

its O
alright O

A O
few O
tips O
: O
skip O
the O
turnip O
cake O
, O
roast O
pork O
buns O
and O
egg O
custards O
. O

wont O
come O
back O
again O
for O
sure O
! O

the O
spinach O
is O
fresh O
, O
definately O
not O
frozen O
... O

The O
only O
thing O
the O
waiters O
don't O
do O
for O
you O
is O
wipe O
your O
chin O
when O
you O
leave O
. O

Kudos O
to O
these O
guys O
. O

Great O
Shabu O
Shabu O

I O
also O
ordered O
the O
Change O
Mojito O
, O
which O
was O
out O
of O
this O
world O
. O

Having O
hunted O
around O
for O
a O
quiet O
, O
romantic O
, O
yet O
not O
hideously O
expensive O
restaurant O
I O
stumbled O
across O
reviews O
for O
La O
Lanterna O
and O
gave O
it O
a O
shot O
. O

I O
went O
here O
on O
a O
recommendation O
and O
will O
surely O
return O
time O
and O
time O
again O
. O

Frankly O
, O
when O
you O
compare O
what O
you O
can O
have O
here O
for O
lunch O
, O
versus O
McDs O
or O
so O
many O
other O
sandwich O
shops O
in O
the O
city O
, O
there O
is O
no O
comparison O
. O

Great O
friendly O
service O
, O
Fast O
seating O
, O
Fast O
Delivery O
, O
Excellent O
sushi O
. O

On O
our O
last O
visit O
, O
they O
skipped O
over O
our O
name O
on O
the O
list O
, O
leaving O
us O
waiting O
an O
extra O
hour O
for O
a O
table O
. O

I O
sometimes O
see O
the O
waiters O
don't O
have O
enough O
knowledge O
of O
their O
dishes O
. O

Then O
, O
to O
top O
things O
off O
, O
she O
dropped O
used O
silverware O
on O
my O
boyfriend's O
jacket O
and O
did O
not O
stop O
to O
apologize O
or O
clean O
the O
mess O
that O
was O
left O
on O
clothes O
. O

Try O
the O
sea O
bass O
. O

Nice O
value O
. O

We O
picked O
it O
randomly O
, O
without O
a O
recommendation O
from O
someone O
who O
has O
been O
there O
, O
so O
we O
weren't O
sure O
what O
to O
expect O
. O

The O
view O
is O
breathtaking O
the O
service O
is O
top O
notch O
... O
the O
ambiance O
is O
wonderfull O
. O

To O
the O
owners O
of O
Open O
Sesame O
... O
Bravo O
... O
I O
can't O
wait O
to O
come O
back O
to O
dine O
at O
your O
restaurant O
! O

I O
liked O
the O
atmosphere O
very O
much O
but O
the O
food O
was O
not O
worth O
the O
price O
. O

I O
tried O
a O
couple O
other O
dishes O
but O
wasn't O
too O
impressed O
. O

Good O
eats O
. O

The O
fish O
was O
adequate O
, O
but O
inexpertly O
sliced O
. O

Mine O
tasted O
like O
the O
bartender O
had O
forgotten O
to O
add O
the O
tequila O
. O

Should O
have O
gone O
to O
Trader O
Joe's O
and O
had O
frozen O
pizza O
:( O

Dessert O
is O
a O
joke O
... O
dont O
bother O

Would O
NEVER O
go O
back O
there O
. O

A O
fairly O
late O
entry O
into O
the O
haute O
barnyard O
sweepstakes O
, O
Flatbush O
Farm O
isn't O
in O
the O
same O
league O
as O
the O
Blue O
Hills O
or O
even O
the O
Farm O
on O
Adderlys O
of O
the O
world O
, O
but O
it's O
pretty O
good O
, O
albeit O
with O
a O
somewhat O
dismal O
setting O
. O

The O
decor O
is O
very O
simple O
but O
comfortable O
. O

The O
only O
drawback O
is O
that O
this O
place O
is O
really O
expensive O
and O
the O
portions O
are O
on O
the O
small O
side O
. O

The O
service O
was O
quick O
and O
friendly O
. O

Either O
that O
, O
or O
the O
editor's O
idea O
of O
romance O
must O
be O
sharing O
a O
conversation O
with O
the O
next O
table O
, O
while O
trying O
to O
speak O
louder O
than O
the O
traffic O
on O
57th O
. O

the O
last O
time O
i O
walked O
by O
it O
looked O
pretty O
empty O
. O
hmmm O
. O

The O
appetizer O
of O
oysters O
, O
lobster O
, O
crab O
( O
small O
size O
) O
made O
a O
perfect O
entre O
for O
my O
wife O
. O

Definitely O
worth O
the O
trip O
to O
Battery O
Park O
City O
! O

The O
vibe O
is O
very O
relaxed O
and O
cozy O
, O
service O
was O
great O
and O
the O
food O
was O
excellent O
! O

Good O
luck O
getting O
a O
table O
. O

not O
chewy O
at O
all O
. O

The O
sake O
menu O
should O
not O
be O
overlooked O
! O

I O
would O
recommend O
to O
ask O
for O
a O
bigger O
sitting O
area O
when O
you O
make O
a O
reservation O
( O
if O
possible O
) O

Highly O
recommended O
to O
all O
! O

They O
honored O
reservation O
on O
Sunday O
afternoon O
very O
well O
. O

The O
porcini O
mushroom O
pasta O
special O
was O
tasteless O
, O
so O
was O
the O
seafood O
tagliatelle O
. O

I O
go O
twice O
a O
month O
! O

This O
place O
has O
got O
to O
be O
the O
best O
japanese O
restaurant O
in O
the O
new O
york O
area O
. O

I O
can't O
believe O
people O
complain O
about O
no O
cheese O
sticks O
? O

We O
took O
advanatage O
of O
the O
half O
price O
sushi O
deal O
on O
saturday O
so O
it O
was O
well O
worth O
it O
. O

– O
In O
a O
age O
of O
incremental O
cost O
cutting O
in O
restaurants O
, O
its O
nice O
to O
see O
a O
place O
that O
bucks O
that O
trend O
, O
and O
just O
plain O
delivers O
high O
quality O
food O
and O
good O
service O
, O
period O
. O

Been O
there O
, O
done O
that O
, O
and O
New O
York O
, O
it's O
not O
that O
big O
a O
deal O
. O

We O
were O
charged O
full O
price O
. O

We O
weren't O
! O

Finally O
a O
meal O
that O
you O
will O
remember O
for O
a O
long O
time O
! O

I O
have O
been O
to O
Casimir O
over O
5 O
times O
and O
I O
have O
always O
had O
a O
great O
time O
there O
. O

Bukhara O
Grill O

the O

" O

Our O
waiter O
was O
non-existent O
and O
after O
our O
food O
finally O
arrived O
over O
an O
hour O
after O
we O
ordered O
, O
we O
were O
not O
given O
any O
water O
or O
utensils O
. O

Atmosphere O
is O
nice O
and O
relaxed O
too O
... O

The O
upside O
of O
the O
restaurant O
? O

The O
appetizer O
was O
interesting O
, O
but O
the O
Creme O
Brulee O
was O
very O
savory O
and O
delicious O
. O

Best O
Crab O

in O
Town O

They O
have O
all O
been O
tonight O
and O
they O
have O
all O
been O
about O
the O
same O
restaurant O
. O

The O
food O
was O
very O
good O
, O
filet O
mignon O
was O
probably O
the O
best O
I've O
ever O
try O
. O

The O
portions O
are O
big O
though O
, O
so O
do O
not O
order O
too O
much O
. O

From O
the O
street O
it O
looks O
very O
hidden O
, O
and O
is O
actually O
an O
old O
warehouse O
. O

I O
had O
the O
Kafta O
plate O
and O
it O
was O
perfect O
. O

The O
waitress O
appeared O
and O
asked O
us O
if O
we O
wanted O
to O
go O
ahead O
and O
order O
. O

Ahhh O
... O

The O
most O
pleasant O
surprise O
was O
the O
check O
that O
did O
not O
exceed O
my O
expectations O
as O
it O
always O
happens O
in O
most O
of O
the O
places O
. O

We O
had O
Pam's O
special O
fried O
fish O
and O
it O
was O
amazing O
. O

MMMMMMMMMmmmmmm O
so O
delicious O

The O
rice O
to O
fish O
ration O
was O
also O
good--they O
didn't O
try O
to O
overpack O
the O
rice O
. O

If O
you O
ware O
looking O
for O
Korean O
fusion O
, O
I O
suggest O
you O
try O
some O
of O
the O
places O
in O
the O
East O
Village O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
place O
to O
take O
out-of-towners O
, O
and O
perfect O
for O
watching O
the O
sunset O
. O

– O
The O
atmosphere O
is O
great O
for O
any O
special O
occasion O
you O
might O
want O
to O
celebrate O
. O

The O
rolls O
are O
creative O
and O
I O
have O
yet O
to O
find O
another O
sushi O
place O
that O
serves O
up O
more O
inventive O
yet O
delicious O
japanese O
food O
. O

Was O
there O
Friday O
night O
. O

I O
would O
defiantly O
come O
back O
here O
again O
as O
one O
of O
my O
top O
choices O
. O

I O
book O
a O
gorgeous O
white O
organza O
tent O
which O
included O
a O
four O
course O
prix O
fix O
menu O
which O
we O
enjoyed O
a O
lot O
. O

I O
have O
been O
living O
in O
NYC O
for O
bit O
now O
and O
I O
have O
to O
say O
I O
love O
to O
go O
out O
and O
explore O
the O
scene O
. O

I O
recommend O
this O
place O
to O
everyone O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
that O
my O
friend O
left O
out O
is O
that O
when O
we O
sat O
down O
at O
the O
bar O
the O
bartender O
disappeared O
. O

It O
costs O
$ O
2 O
extra O
to O
turn O
a O
regular O
roll O
into O
an O
inside-out O
roll O
, O
but O
the O
roll O
more O
than O
triples O
in O
size O
, O
and O
that's O
not O
just O
from O
the O
rice O
. O

– O
Best O
Mexican O
place O
for O
lunch O
in O
the O
financial O
district O
. O

At O
this O
point O
, O
the O
waitress O
comes O
over O
and O
asks O
us O
if O
everything O
was O
okay O
, O
I O
was O
literally O
so O
shocked O
that O
I O
was O
speechless O
and O
didn't O
say O
anything O
, O
and O
guess O
what O
, O
the O
waitress O
WALKED O
away O
. O

im O
not O
necessarily O
fanatical O
about O
this O
place O
, O
but O
it O
was O
a O
fun O
time O
for O
low O
pirces O
. O

All O
in O
all O
the O
food O
was O
good O
- O
a O
little O
on O
the O
expensive O
side O
, O
but O
fresh O
. O

plus O
, O
i O
am O
allergic O
to O
rice O
, O
and O
the O
waitstaff O
was O
unbelievably O
accomodating O
- O
- O
didn't O
even O
bat O
an O
eye O
! O

The O
food O
is O
okay O
and O
the O
prices O
here O
are O
mediocre O
. O

Although O
we O
were O
told O
10-15 O
minutes O
and O
it O
was O
more O
like O
45 O
minutes O
. O

However O
, O
most O
of O
them O
are O
at O
least O
prompt O
and O
pleasant O
. O

The O
sauce O
tasted O
more O
like O
Chinese O
fast O
food O
than O
decent O
Korean O
. O

Very O
pleased O

We O
had O
a O
good O
time O
. O

This O
little O
place O
definitely O
exceeded O
my O
expectations O
and O
you O
sure O
get O
a O
lot O
of O
food O
for O
your O
money O
. O

This O
is O
such O
a O
lovely O
, O
peaceful O
place O
to O
eat O
outside O
. O

The O
menu O
looked O
great O
, O
and O
the O
waiter O
was O
very O
nice O
, O
but O
when O
the O
food O
came O
, O
it O
was O
average O
. O

Nice O
ambience O
, O
but O
highly O
overrated O
place O
. O

Some O
of O
the O
food O
is O
clearly O
oriented O
toward O
foodies O
( O
like O
me O
) O
so O
if O
your O
not O
a O
foodie O
( O
nothing O
wrong O
with O
that O
) O
- O
head O
over O
to O
McDonalds O
or O
some O
Ruby O
Tuesday O
and O
have O
at O
it O
! O

about O

the O

by O

the O

The O

The O
outside O

has O
an O

For O
desserts O
, O
we O
tried O
the O

( O
interesting O
but O
not O
extraordinary O
) O
and O

( O

, O
which O
was O
phenomenal O
. O

( O
that O
is O
A O
MUST O
, O
but O
not O
every O
restaurant O
can O
do O
... O
) O

Delicious O

. O

bottles O

are O
cheap O
and O
good O
. O

I O
swore O
never O
to O
return O
for O
a O
warm O
beer O
and O
mediocre O
meal O
. O

Oh O
, O
and O
the O
cheese O
fries O
are O
awesome O
! O

( O
Always O
ask O
the O
bartender O
for O
the O
SEASONAL O
beer O
! O
! O
! O

It's O
boring O
on O
the O
inside O
, O
and O
our O
sushi O
was O
pretty O
below O
average O
... O
the O
tuna O
was O
soggy O
and O
the O
other O
rolls O
had O
no O
flavor O
. O

The O
wine O
list O
is O
extensive O
and O
can O
easily O
hike O
up O
an O
otherwise O
reasonably O
priced O
meal O
. O

I O
can't O
saybenough O
good O
things O
about O
this O
restaurant O
, O
and O
I O
can't O
wait O
for O
my O
next O
several O
visits O
. O

We O
ordered O
our O
appetizers O
, O
I O
ordered O
the O
chicken O
and O
my O
boyfriend O
the O
salmon O
. O

– O
I O
will O
never O
forget O
the O
amazing O
meal O
, O
service O
, O
and O
ambiance O
I O
experience O
at O
this O
restaurant O
. O

The O
hostess O
was O
rude O
and O
I O
got O
a O
distinct O
feeling O
that O
they O
did O
not O
want O
to O
serve O
us O
. O

I O
loved O
it O
and O
would O
go O
again O
. O

Food O
is O
usually O
very O
good O
, O
though O
ocasionally O
I O
wondered O
about O
freshmess O
of O
raw O
vegatables O
in O
side O
orders O
. O

Not O
the O
biggest O
portions O
but O
adequate O
. O

But O
, O
they O
were O
too O
big O
for O
the O
bun O
. O

The O
service O
was O
extremely O
fast O
and O
attentive O
( O
thanks O
to O
the O
service O
button O
on O
your O
table O
) O
but O
I O
barely O
understood O
1 O
word O
when O
the O
waiter O
took O
our O
order O
. O

Guess O
what O
, O
I O
waited O
for O
TWENTY O
minutes O
before O
she O
came O
over O
and O
when O
she O
finally O
did O
, O
she O
says O
, O
" O
oh O
well O
, O
I O
wish O
you O
would O
have O
said O
something O
earlier O
" O
No O
apology O
, O
nothing O
. O

I O
went O
there O
with O
my O
friend O
last O
saturday O
. O

You O

but O
: O
Cassuolet O
, O
Steake O
Fritte O
, O
Tripe O
Stew O
, O
etc O
; O
simple O
stuff O
. O

There O
are O
other O
people O
waiting O
! O

This O
restaurant O
was O
recommended O
by O
a O
local O
... O
as O
a O
matter O
of O
fact O
, O
he O
made O
the O
reservation O
for O
us O
and O
said O
we O
would O
not O
be O
disappointed O
! O

Every O
time O
I O
have O
a O
special O
occasion O
with O
my O

I O
have O
a O
hard O
time O

anywhere O
else O
. O

This O
place O
is O
great O
. O

awesome O
find O

And O
I O
hate O
to O
say O
this O
but O
I O
doubt O
I'll O
ever O
go O
back O
. O

Two O
complaints O
- O
their O
appetizer O
selection O
stinks O
, O
it O
would O
be O
nice O
to O
get O
some O
mozzarella O
sticks O
on O
the O
menu O
. O

You O
will O
find O
yourself O
returning O
quite O
often O
. O

Better O
than O
nobu O
, O
tomoe O
, O
taka O
, O
yama O
, O
sugiyama O
, O
and O
the O
rest O
. O

Sunday O
afternoons O
there O
is O
a O
band O
playing O
and O
it O
is O
lots O
of O
fun O
. O

What O
more O
could O
you O
want O
? O

Awesome O

I'm O
not O
kidding O
. O

The O
large O
selection O
of O
bruschettas O
, O
paninis O
, O
tramezzinis O
keep O
the O
palate O
from O
stagnating O
. O

We've O
found O
it O
to O
be O
better O
and O
fresher O
than O
Kiku O
which O
is O
comparable O
in O
price O
. O

We O
arrived O
and O
were O
seated O
immediately O
, O
which O
made O
us O
both O
happy O
. O

I O

I O
LOVE O
their O
Thai O

Nice O
atmosphere O
, O
the O
service O
was O
very O
pleasant O
and O
the O

was O
fully O
loaded O

I O
was O

a O
few O
weeks O
back O
and O
we O
had O
the O
worst O
customer O

experience O
at O
a O
restaurant O
ever O
. O

The O
owner O
truly O
caters O
to O
all O
your O
needs O

Try O
the O
Pad O

they're O
all O
delicious O

Our O

the O

costly O
experience O

Overrated O

We O
ordered O
a O

of O

and O
the O

this O
location O
and O

Celebrated O
my O
fathers O
birthday O
here O
. O

If O
you O
venture O
off O
the O
island O
of O
Manhattan O
and O
can't O
seem O
to O
find O
a O
great O
Italian O
restaurant O
, O
drive O
to O
Corona O
. O

Nothing O
really O
came O
across O
as O
outstanding O
. O

I O
was O
shocked O
that O
my O
friends O
wanted O
to O
stay O
after O
the O
waitress O
said O
, O
" O
can O
I O
help O
you O
" O
and O
" O
how O
many O
are O
in O
your O
party O
. O
" O

Oh O
I O
forgot O
to O
mention O
that O
they O
don't O
have O
bread O
service O
. O

The O
rice O
was O
poor O
quality O
and O
was O
cooked O
so O
badly O
it O
was O
hard O
. O

The O
setting O
is O
casual O
and O
romantic O
. O

i O
know O
, O
you O
were O
too O
busy O
showing O
off O
your O
vintage O
tee O
shirt O
and O
looking O
bored O
, O
but O
my O
agenda O
is O
i'm O
here O
to O
eat O
and O
enjoy O
the O
company O
of O
friends O
, O
seeking O
a O
pleasant O
experience O
. O

The O
atmosphere O
is O
relaxed O
and O
casual O
. O

And O
even O
more O
so O
unpleasant O
because O
it O
was O
so O
costly O
for O
such O
an O
unpleasant O
experience O
. O

The O
presentation O
of O
Snooze O
is O
excellent O
and O
it O
is O
one O
of O
those O
places O
that O
you O
feel O
more O
sophisticated O
just O
for O
being O
there O
; O
but O
peel O
back O
the O
layers O
and O
you O
have O
an O
overpriced O
IHOP O
with O
a O
high O
brow O
menu O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
this O
beautiful O
place O
. O

Price O
is O
high O
but O
the O
food O
is O
good O
, O
so O
I O
would O
come O
back O
again O
. O

Service O
is O
fast O
and O
friendly O
. O

I O
would O
never O
recommend O
this O
place O
to O
anybody O
even O
for O
a O
casual O
dinner O
. O

The O
food O
is O
not O
what O
it O
once O
was O
( O
potions O
have O
seriously O
seen O
downsizing O
) O
prices O
have O
gone O
up O
, O
and O
the O
service O
is O
the O
worst O
I O
have O
experienced O
anywhere O
( O
including O
mainland O
Europe O
) O
. O

I O
have O
worked O
in O
restaurants O
and O
cook O
a O
lot O
, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
way O
a O
maggot O
should O
be O
able O
to O
get O
into O
well O
prepared O
food O
. O

If O
you've O
ever O
been O
along O

idea O
of O
the O
top O
of O

to O
offer O
. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
the O
fish O
tacos O
, O
everything O
else O
was O
ok O
. O

Food O
took O
some O
time O
to O
prepare O
, O
all O
worth O
waiting O
for O
. O

the O
drinks O
are O
amazing O
and O

Be O
sure O
not O
to O
get O
anything O
other O
than O
bagels O
! O

I O
showed O
it O
to O
the O
manager O
, O
and O
he O
smilingly O
apologized O
and O
brought O
us O
two O
free O
desserts O
( O
but O
did O
not O
ask O
us O
what O
we O
wanted O
and O
so O
brought O
the O
last O
two O
desserts O
we O
would O
have O
asked O
for O
) O
. O

Helpful O
service O
and O
average O

Best O

over O

Each O
time O
we've O
been O
, O
the O
front O
of O
house O
staff O
( O
not O
the O
waiters O
- O
they're O
fantastic O
- O
but O
the O
people O
who O
greet O
and O
seat O
you O
) O
has O
been O
so O
hideous O
to O
us O
that O
were O
it O
not O
for O
the O
exceptional O
fish O
dishes O
I O
would O
never O
return O
. O

Have O
frequented O
' O
ino O
for O
several O
years O
and O
the O
food O
remains O
excellent O
. O

The O
service O
was O
impeccable O
and O
unobtrusive O
- O
- O
the O
staff O
knows O
what O
they O
are O
there O
to O
do O
- O
- O
to O
know O
their O
menu O
, O
present O
your O
meal O
, O
and O
attend O
to O
your O
needs O
. O

While O
it O
is O
understandable O
that O
every O
place O
is O
indeed O
different O
, O
there O
was O
not O
a O
need O
to O
be O
uncourteous O
to O
customers O
and O
downright O
rude O
. O

The O
wait O
staff O
is O
very O
freindly O
, O
they O
make O
it O
feel O
like O
you're O
eating O
in O
a O
freindly O
little O
european O
town O
. O

Shame O
on O
this O
place O
for O
the O
horrible O
rude O
staff O
and O
non-existent O
customer O
service O
. O

Service O
was O
also O
horrible O
and O
the O
ambience O
is O
not O
that O
great O
. O

The O
onion O
rings O
are O
great O
! O

splendid O

Fabulous O
decor O
- O
makes O
you O
feel O
like O
you're O
in O
a O
trendy O
Manhattan O
restaurant O
, O
very O
very O
good O
food O
, O
cheaply-priced O
, O
generally O
friendly O
staff O
, O
and O
if O
you're O
a O
Manhattanite O
, O
or O
spend O
most O
of O
your O
time O
in O
Manhattan O
, O
Rice O
Avenue O
will O
make O
you O
feel O
at O
home O
... O
very O
Soho O
/ O
Village O
/ O
Upper O
West O
Side O
minus O
the O
expensive O
prices O
and O
pretentious O
clientele O
... O
all O
on O
Roosevelt O
Avenue O
! O

I O
am O
actually O
offended O
to O
have O
spent O
so O
much O
money O
on O
such O
a O
bad O
experience O
. O

Not O
enough O
wines O
by O
the O
glass O
either O
. O

Hands O
down O
the O
best O
pizza O
on O
the O
planet O
. O

Old O
Reliable O

How O
this O
place O
survives O
the O
competitive O
west O
village O
market O
in O
this O
economy O
, O
or O
any O
other O
for O
that O
matter O
, O
is O
beyond O
me O
. O

They O
are O
not O
greasy O
or O
anything O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
more O
wonderful O
than O
the O
food O
( O
which O
is O
exceptional O
) O
is O
the O
service O
. O

This O
place O
is O
the O
most O
Japanese O
it O
can O
ever O
get O
. O

One O
of O
the O
best O
, O
if O
not O
THE O
best O
, O
restaurants O
in O
Park O
Slope O
( O
and O
NY O
in O
general O
) O

Calling O
the O
place O
Hampton O
Chutney O
Co O
. O
does O
warn O
you O
that O
these O
folks O
offer O
more O
style O
than O
substance O
, O
but O
in O
this O
unattractive O
room O
with O
unhelpful O
clerks O
there O
was O
a O
dearth O
of O
the O
former O
too O
. O

The O
ambience O
is O
pretty O
and O
nice O
for O
conversation O
, O
so O
a O
casual O
lunch O
here O
would O
probably O
be O
best O
. O

Maybe O
I'll O
go O
back O
once O
more O
many O
years O
from O
now O
when O
I've O
forgotten O
I O
went O
there O
already O
. O

In O
the O
end O
our O
check O
came O
to O
$ O
27 O
for O
4 O
small O
pancakes O
, O
a O
breakfast O
burrito O
, O
an O
orange O
juice O
and O
an O
iced O
tea O
( O
I O
had O
water O
) O
. O

I O
will O
NEVER O
return O
. O

Went O
to O
Village O
last O
night O
for O
my O
birthday O
. O

Be O
prepared O
to O
wait O
, O
because O
the O
place O
is O
pretty O
tiny O
. O

My O
chow O
fun O
and O
chow O
see O
was O
really O
bland O
and O
oily O
. O

not O
sure O
why O
this O
restaurant O
would O
be O
rated O
that O
highly O
. O
