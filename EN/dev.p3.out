When O

I O
didn't O
think O
I O
would O
be O
able O
to O

but O
I O
was O
able O
to O
get O
in O
, O
along B-negative
with O
four O
other O
guests O
. O

The O
tuna B-positive
and I-positive
wasabe I-positive

are O
excellent O
. O

My O
favortie B-neutral
pizza I-neutral
joint O
in O
Seattle O

Food B-neutral
wise I-neutral
, O
its O
ok O
but O
a O
bit O
pricey O
for O
what O
you O
get O
considering O
the O
restaurant B-negative
isn't I-negative
a O
fancy B-negative
place O
. O

– O
tucked B-negative
away O
over O
by O
the O
Beverly B-neutral
Center I-neutral
. O

My O
mouth O
felt O
very O
dry O
afterwards B-negative
and O
I O
had O
that O
signature B-negative
? O
MSG B-negative
? O
taste O
lingering B-negative
in O
my O
throat B-negative
after O
I O
left O
the O
restaurant O
. O

It's O
a O
tiny O
place O
so O
if O
you O
get O
there O
before O
8p B-neutral
m I-neutral
on O
a O
weekend B-positive
( I-positive
Thurs I-positive
? O
Sun B-negative
) O
you O
will O
find O
it O
easier B-negative
to O
get O
a O
table O
or O
a O
seat O
at O
the O
sushi B-positive
bar I-positive
. O

The O
wine B-positive
list I-positive
is O
wonderful O
and O
the O
food B-neutral
reminds I-neutral
me O
of O
my O
recent B-negative
trip O
to O
Italy B-negative
. O

We O
all O
agreed B-negative
that O
mare B-negative
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
seafood B-positive
restaurants O
in O
New O
York O
. O

Believe B-neutral
it O
baby B-negative
! O

We O
have O
since O
returned B-negative
and O
also O
had O
a O
great O
experience O
, O
sampling B-negative
more O
small O
plates O
and O
a O
variety O
of O
the O
beer O
( O
cold O
and O
good O
) O
. O

Compared B-negative
to I-negative
Ess-a I-negative
, O
Tal B-negative
offers O
a O
less O
doughy B-negative
bagel O
! O

It O
was O
so O
much O
though O
that O
I O
could O
barely O
finish B-negative
but O
I O
did O
, O
since O
it O
was O
delicious O
. O

the O
staff B-positive
was O
very O
nice O
and O
courteous B-neutral
and I-neutral
obviously I-neutral
chinese I-neutral
. O

This O
was O
, O
from O
start O
to O
finish B-negative
, O
a O
mind-bogglingly B-neutral
uncomfortable I-neutral
experience O
. O

I O
went O
here O
with O
a O
friend O
on O
a O
whim B-negative
, O
we O
went O
someplace B-negative
else O
first O
and O
couldn't B-negative
get O
a O
table O
. O

We O
concluded B-positive
with I-positive
tiramisu I-positive
chocolate I-positive
cake I-positive
, O
both O
were O
delicious O
. O

Not O
much O
of O
a O

either O
, O
we O
went O
with O

This O
review O
is O
for O
the O
Southglen B-negative
location O

: O
I O
wish O
this O
review O
would O
make O
a O
difference B-negative
enough O
for O
it O
to O
be O
addressed B-negative
by O
management B-negative
but O
Snooze B-negative
has O
people B-positive
climbing I-positive
over I-positive
each O
other O
for O
a O
chance O
to O
eat O
at O
this O
overpriced O
restaurant O
with O
mediocre O
food B-positive

service B-positive
, O
so O
this O
review O
as O
well O
as O
the O
other O
negative B-neutral
ones I-neutral
for O
their O
Larimer B-negative
location O
will O

Good O
Experience O

The B-neutral
lox I-neutral

Although O
we O
were O
looking O
for O
regular B-neutral
lettuce I-neutral
and O
some O
walnuts B-negative
the I-negative
salads I-negative
we O
got O
were O
great O
. O

We've O
tried O
before O

it O
always O
packed O

doesn't O
take O

Beautiful B-neutral

And O
it O

The O
location O

ambience B-positive
is O
Ok B-negative

the O
food B-positive
is O
what O
makes O
up O
for O
it O
. O

I O
literally B-negative
just O
got O
back O
home O
after O
visiting O
Casa B-negative
La I-negative
Femme I-negative
and O
was O
so O
offended B-negative
by O
my O
visit O
felt O
it O
necessary B-negative
to O
try O
and O
warn B-negative
other O
diners B-negative
who O
value O
their O
money O
and O
time O
. O

The O
place O
itself O
is O
beautiful O
the O

scene B-positive
seems O
to O

Also O
, O
the O
sandwiches B-positive
( I-positive
nearing I-positive
$ O

didn't O
come O
with O
anything O
like O

a O
side O

The B-negative
stuff I-negative
tilapia I-negative
was O
horrid B-negative
... O
tasted O
like O
cardboard B-negative

You O
can O
easily B-negative
hear O
him O
though O
so O
it O
was O
a O
pleasant O
sound B-negative
and O
not O
overbearing B-negative

It's O
definately B-negative
not O
a O
place O
to O
go O
if O
you O
want O
to O
impress B-negative
someone O
. O

The O
lamb B-positive
was O
tender B-negative

take O
my O

We O
refused B-negative

it O
because O
at O
this O
point O
it O
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
the O

The B-neutral

some O

I've O
had O

I O
really O
enjoyed O
the O

Single B-positive
Worst I-positive
Restaurant I-positive
in O
Manhattan O

Inside B-neutral
is O
a O
little O
cramped B-negative
, O
but O
to O
be O
expected O

However O
, O
they O
do O
take O
your O
cellphone B-neutral
numbers I-neutral
so O
that O
you O
can O
go O
hang O
out O
somewhere B-negative

you O
up O
on O

japanese O
sushi O
place B-negative
or I-negative
Spanish I-negative

this O
creation B-negative
in I-negative
Williamsburg I-negative

Not O
one O

to O
complaints B-positive
( I-positive
hence I-positive
my O
lack B-negative
of O
previous O
online B-neutral

, O
I O
called O
the O

that O
their O

to O
check O
the O

I'm O
glad B-negative
I O
was O
introduced B-negative
to O
this O
place O
and O
this O
is O
a O
rare B-negative
gem O
in O
NY O
. O

It's O
a O
rather O
cramped B-negative
and O
busy O
restaurant O
and O
it O
closes B-negative
early O

The O

– O
As O
with O
most O

in O
Seattle O

Mioposto's B-negative
service I-negative
was O
bad O

the O
food B-positive
was O

Great O

the O

We O

There O
is O
something O
about O
their O

that O
makes O
me O
come O
back O
nearly O
every O
week O
. O

The O
last O
two O
times O
I O
ordered O
from O
here O
my O
food B-positive
was O
soo B-positive
spicy I-positive
that O
I O
could O
barely O
eat O
it O
, O
and O
the O
spice B-negative
took O
away O
from O
the O
flavor O
of O
the O

Quite B-neutral
frankly I-neutral
, O
this O
is O
some O
of O
the O
worst O
sushi O
I O
have O
ever O
tried O

If O
I O

I O

With O
the O
exception B-negative
of O
our O
lemon B-positive
salad I-positive
that O
had O
so O
much O
pepper B-negative
on O
it O
that O
our O
eyes B-neutral

the O
food B-positive

was O
decent O

the O
dim B-neutral
sum I-neutral

though O
pricey O
by O

is O
worth O
it O

Much B-neutral

modern B-positive
Japanese I-positive
brasserie I-positive
( I-positive
that O

one O

My O
husband O
said O
he O
could've B-negative
eaten O
several O
more O
, O
the O
portion O
was O
fine O
for O
me O
he O
even O
exclaimed B-negative
that O
the O
french B-neutral
fries I-neutral
were O
the O
best O
he O
has O
had O

We O
asked O
for O
sides B-negative

the O
waiter B-negative
than O
admitted B-negative
that O
he O
forgot B-negative
to O
put O
in O
that O

our O
order O

I O
am O
bringing B-negative
my O

After O

the O
manager B-negative
grabbed I-negative
my O

It O

My O

On O
the O

out O

The O
portions B-positive

We O
all O

If O
you O
